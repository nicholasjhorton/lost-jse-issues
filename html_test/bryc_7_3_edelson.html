<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Students crack a simple substitution code using
character frequencies in texts sampled from web pages. 
Frequencies are tabulated by a web-based character
counter.  This quick and simple project reinforces notions
of sampling variability and emphasizes the need to
complement statistical techniques with intuition.</p>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>1 Instructors want  students to think of statistics as a
process for gaining information, rather than merely
plugging numbers into formulas. They want students to
understand variability and how it is related to
statistics.  Accordingly,  educators recommend that
introductory statistics courses should emphasize data
collection, variation, graphical display of data, design of
experiments and surveys, and problem solving (<a href="#Easton-Roberts-Tiao">Easton, Roberts, and Tiao
1988</a>; <a href="#Hogg(1991)">Hogg 1991</a>, <a href="#Hogg(1992)">1992</a>; <a href="#Moore">Moore
1992</a>). They also recommend new formats for class
activities that rely on writing, projects, and
experimentation (<a href="#Fillebrown(1994)">Fillebrown
1994</a>, <a href="#Giraud(1997)">Giraud 1997</a>, </a><a href="#Roberts">Roberts 1992</a>).

<p> 2 A number of interesting class activities can benefit
from the Internet.  Perhaps the best known Internet
resources are searchable datasets and online case studies
(<a href="gate/bryclink1.html">http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL/DataArchive.html</a>,
<a href="gate/bryclink2.html">http://www.stat.ucla.edu/cases/</a>),
online statistical software (<a href="gate/bryclink3.html">http://fonsg3.let.uva.nl:8001/Service/Statistics.html</a>,
<a href="gate/bryclink4.html">http://www.stat.ucla.edu/calculators/cdf/</a>),
and online textbooks (<a href="#Dear">Dear 1995</a>, <a href="#Lane">Lane 1993</a>, <a href="#Stockburger">Stockburger 1996</a>). A sampling
activity described in <a href="#Schwarz(1997)">Schwarz
(1997)</a> uses the Internet in a novel way that would  be
difficult to implement without a computer.

<p>3  This note presents a short hands-on project that
relies on interactive capabilities of  the Internet. The
World Wide Web format assures access to the project from
all operating systems. It also allows the instructor to
assign different versions of the project among the
students, or  groups of students. With Web-based computer
support this is actually a short project, not much more
than a homework assignment.

<p>4 This project  introduces students to a simple 
decoding problem. Students are asked to  decipher an
encrypted text provided by the instructor.  The task is
straightforward to explain, yet at first seems
inapproachable. The decoding of the encrypted text is based
on comparisons between the  frequencies of characters in
the encrypted text and  the frequencies of characters in a
plain text of the student's choice, or in several such
texts.   The  statistical tools used in the project are
summary statistics and sampling. To complete the project,
students  must also  incorporate critical thinking  to make
use of all available information.

<p> 5 The project forces the students to face the fact that
sample data vary and different texts can give different
percentages for the same character.  Students realize that
by analyzing multiple texts they can estimate the range of
values attained by the sample proportion of a character.
They learn  to use approximate percentages of characters.
They also learn that while statistics provides a good
starting point, intuition, critical thinking, and even
lucky guesses are important.

<h1>
2. Decoding a Substitution Code</h1>

<p>6 The encoded text consists of characters: letters,
spaces, punctuation marks, numbers, and other printable
keyboard symbols, which are encoded by a  <i>simple
substitution code</i>.  This means that every character in
the original text is replaced by some other character, its
substitution code.  The term "simple" refers to the fact
that a single substitution rule is used throughout the
encoded text. Capital letters might be coded by a different
character than the corresponding lower case letters, and
all punctuation characters and spaces are encoded too.

<p>7 The basic method for decoding a substitution code is
to compare the frequencies of characters in the encoded
text and the frequencies of characters in a text written in
plain English. The characters that occur most frequently in
the coded text correspond to the most frequent characters
in plain English. Similarly, the frequencies of the
combinations of characters (pairs, triplets) within the
coded text should match the frequencies of corresponding 
combinations of characters in any sufficiently long text.

<p>8 The main statistical step is to create  tables of
character frequencies that will be used to compare the
coded text to a plain English text. To facilitate
statistical comparison, the encrypted texts should be quite
long, although the objective of the project is to decode
only the first sentence.  The cumbersome task of counting
the characters is automated by the <a href="count-char.cfm"> online character counter</a>. The
character counter works best with  texts in electronic
formats that can be copied and pasted into the WWW-based
input form. The output of the program is a printable table
of  the frequencies of characters, including punctuation
marks and other printable characters in the text.

<p>9 Comparing the proportions of characters is only a good
starting point.  Students quickly discover the meaning of a
couple of the characters in the cipher. The first character
to crack is the space that separates the words; the
proportion of spaces in  English is substantially higher
than the proportions of other characters.  Next, the letter
"e" is  easily identified in most texts.  Typically the
direct comparison method breaks down at this point and
should be stopped because other characters cannot be
reliably matched solely on the basis of their frequencies.

<p>10 The next step is to decipher more characters by
trying to decode short  and frequent words,  like "a,"
"the," "and," and "is." Statistics helps to choose among
the alternatives  when a word can be decoded in more than
one way.  For example, we might encounter  an encoded
three-letter  word that we decode as  "ha_", with just one
letter missing. This word  could be completed as "has,"
"had," or "ham" ["hat" can be discarded assuming we already
know the code for "t" from deciphering the code for "the"].
Since the proportions of  letters "m," "s," and "d" are
spaced far apart, we can   make  a reasonably certain
choice by inspecting the table of frequencies of characters
in the coded text. Our choice can also be confirmed by
comparing the frequencies of pairs of letters "am," "ad,"
and  "as" with the frequency of the coded combination in
question. Similarly, three-character combinations can be
inspected.  Every newly deciphered word increases the
number of deciphered characters in the encoded text and
serves as an extra verification, or falsification, of the
previously established matches.




<h1>
3. Experiences With the Decoding Project</h1>

11 This project was used in  Elementary Probability and
Statistics at the University of Cincinnati. This is a
service course taken by students to fulfill a college math
requirement.  Initially, the  project was assigned late in
the course to a small section of 23 students; by this time
these students had already been exposed to statistical
reasoning, including confidence intervals and hypothesis
testing.  Since the project does not rely on formal
statistical procedures, it was also assigned in another
section of 45 students early in the course.


<p> 12 Before the project was assigned,  students were
introduced to sample variability and the use of online
software. As a joint lab activity, students used the
character counter to collect  data on the percentages of
the letters "e" and "t" in various texts.  Collected data
were recorded directly in the  <a href="letters.cfm">class
announcement</a>,  and then used to make a histogram and a
stem-and-leaf plot,  to compute the five-number summary of
the data, and to discuss outliers. In my opinion, a similar
exercise should precede the project. 

<p>13  Prior to the actual decoding project, students
should be exposed to sampling variability by analyzing
several texts from the Web.  This is also an appropriate
moment to discuss the issue of random sampling. Students
easily concur that selecting unusual texts, like
specialized technical papers, is not the best strategy if
the text to decode is suspected to come from a textbook or
a novel.


<p>14 The encoded texts for the project were assigned to
students via Web links from the class list.  Sample <a href="bryc.project.cfm"> project instructions</a> are
available online.  The task of preparing  encrypted texts
was simplified by the encryption function which is
available as part of the character counter.  Its output is
a ready-to-save Web page.  Here are  samples of the encoded
texts produced by the program:
<a href="text1.cfm">text1</a> 
<a href="text2.cfm">text2</a> 
<a href="text3.cfm">text3</a>
<a href="text4.cfm">text4</a>.

<p>15 To make tables of comparative frequencies, students
were asked  to select their own samples of text.  The
project description and  class announcement provided links
to online textbooks and the Gallup poll site as suggested
sources.  Most students followed the suggestion and picked
samples of moderate size (several thousand characters). 
Some students chose very small sample texts from other
sources,  like the actual text of the project instructions.
Some students  analyzed huge pieces of text, hoping to
estimate the proportions more accurately.

<p>16 Confronted with an unmanageable (at first sight)
jungle of symbols, students learned to appreciate the very
first insight that came from comparing proportions of
characters:  they could immediately divide the continuous
string of encrypted text into separate words.  They could
often recognize a couple more characters in a similar
fashion, sometimes  because of numerical coincidences in
the frequencies. Some students commented on the fact that
often such initial matches had to be discarded because they
wouldn't form  sensible words in the encrypted text.  Then
the students were confronted with the fact that most of the
frequencies in the encoded text did not have any clear
match, and it became harder to recognize which code should
match which character.  Inexact matching and trying to
choose letters to make sensible short words was a trial and
error process that used both common sense and occasional
insights.

<p> 17 An effective strategy, noticed in students'
solutions in the first, more experienced class, became part
of the project instructions for the second, less
experienced class.  The strategy was to use the  output of
the character counter to produce a set of potential matches
for each character. This device helps the students to avoid
fixing the matches too early and to visualize their
options.

<p>18 Most students had no difficulty deciphering the first
sentence, and many went on to decode more than was
required.  A few good students  failed to complete the
project because of lack of flexibility -- their attempts to
match the characters rigidly by the order of frequencies
led them into a blind alley.  Some mathematically weaker
students found the project very easy and asked for more
such projects so that they might improve their grades.

<p> 19 None of the students used the frequencies of pairs
or triplets.  Two -- perhaps complementary -- explanations
are that students may have found this information too
complex to take into account, and that they were able to
complete the project using only single-character
frequencies and their ability to fill in the missing
letters in the text.


<h1>4. Character Counter Program</h1>

20 The character counter program used in this project is a
short (about 300 lines of code) Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) script written in Perl 5.0.  The script is invoked
from any Web browser that supports forms.  The script is
executed on the server machine and thus is entirely
independent of the computer system used by the students.
The script can be installed on any system that supports
Perl 5.0 and the CGI.pm library. At the time of this
writing, the script can be moved to any Win32 or Unix
platform with the minimum version of Perl and corresponding
library. The script requires no compilation and can be
modified to support other projects by editing its file and
reformatting the output.  Instructors do not have to
install their own copy of the script.  They can point their
students to the  <a href="count-char.cfm">common access
page</a>, like the one linked to in the  <a href="bryc.project.cfm">sample project</a> and sample
encoded texts 
(<a href="text1.cfm">text1</a> 
<a href="text2.cfm">text2</a> 
<a href="text3.cfm">text3</a>
<a href="text4.cfm">text4</a>).  
Access pages to the same script at a single location can
also be personalized by instructors and placed anywhere on
the Web.

<p>21 Some aspects of the character counter script are not
entirely intuitive and might need clarification.

<ul> <li>The script counts the lower case characters
separately from the upper case characters.  For example,
lower case "t" might be reported as about 6% of the text,
while upper case "T" as only .8%.  This is consistent with
the encryption scheme used in the project where the upper
case letters are encrypted by different characters than the
lower case letters.

<p> <li> The character counter treats white space (blanks)
differently than the rest of the characters.  Invisible
white space is actually made of several different computer
characters: tab, space, new line (sometimes called
end-of-line), and "enter." These are all lumped together,
except for the "new line" which is not counted at all. 
Consecutive occurrences of white space, like two
consecutive spaces, or a tab and a space, are counted as a
single occurrence.

<p> <li> The access page provides an option to count single
characters, pairs, or triplets of characters. If more than
one option is selected, then  groups of various sizes
(singles, pairs, triplets) are all counted together.
Separate tables of frequencies for pairs and triplets are
easily  produced by activating one option at a time or by
using a <a href="Char-ct2.cfm">single-option access
page</a>.

<p> <li> To avoid long  meaningless printouts, the
character counter prints the counts for the first 30
characters.  It will print additional counts for up to 100
character combinations that might occur in a similar text. 
A normal approximation is used to approximate the
probability of occurrence and to calculate the "margin of
error"  for each percentage reported.
