<h1>1. Norgas Distributing Company</h1>

<p>This simulation package generates data over a one to ten year
period (range of years chosen by the user) and stores the
information in a text file which is saved on a floppy disk. It is
understood that the cost of obtaining one year's worth of data is
$1,500. The student must tackle the problem of obtaining an
adequate amount of data yet at the same time controlling the
budget of the analysis. There is no clear indication by the author
as to how much information would be appropriate which seems to be
left as an open question for the student.

<p>Based on the variables available (forecast of the day's
temperature and day's wind by two competing agencies, the actual
day's temperature and wind speed, and the gas demanded for that
day), it seems that some type of multiple regression and/or time
series analysis would be appropriate, but again this analysis is
completely left open.

<p>This simulation would be ideal for students well equipped with
some basic regression/time series tools. The data are stored in a
clearly delimited text file, which is easily accessible to
packages like Excel, SAS, and S-Plus. In addition, several nice
features make the package especially useful to instructors:

<ul>

<li>Students can only run the program once.<br>

After submitting the user's password, the program automatically
updates the password list indicating that the user has already
used the simulation. Due to the $1,500/year analysis cost and the
possibility of the student learning how the simulation machine
works after repeated trials, the one-time-only simulation is a
very nice safeguard feature.

<p>

<li> Instructors can reproduce students' simulations.<br>

For every simulation, the program generates a file accessible to
the instructor that reports the random seed (and sample size) used
for that particular run. This is another safeguard feature that
instructors can rely upon in case they would like to check the
students' work.

<p>

<li> Sample assignments and technical notes are provided.<br>

The author provides a list of questions that would be useful for
instructors as a guideline. In addition, the author provides a
supplemental document for instructors containing technical notes,
including how to set up the program and how to make use of the
password file.

</ul>

<h1>2. Tenderdent Toothpaste</h1>

<p>This simulation package contains three stages: a survey stage,
a test marketing stage, and a full marketing stage. At each stage
the student is given the chance to obtain practice sessions,
 although there is no guarantee that such observations will be
close to what will be seen in the "real" simulation. Again, once
the "real" simulation is carried out, the student is not allowed
to perform it again. As in the Norgas case, instructors can
replicate any of the "real" simulations, as they will have access
to the corresponding random seeds and sample size values.

<p>An interesting feature of this package is that, in addition to
regression, it contains sampling issues including simple vs.
stratified sampling, a two-stage sampling scheme, and various
choices of stratification variables. Students face the problem of
selecting the optimal sampling method only in the first stage.
During the second and third stages, students need to determine
optimal advertising/marketing strategies. Also, students must
adequately control the costs associated with these three stages.
With so many things to consider, it seems reasonable to have
access to practice sessions, whereas in the other two packages the
user has only one attempt.

<p>One point that distinguishes this package from the other two is
clearly the three-stage sequence. It allows students to examine a
large study in a stepwise manner and determine whether it would be
in the client's best interest to move forward at the completion of
each stage.

<h1>3. Superior Insurance Inc.</h1>

<p>This package contains two components. The first simulation
generates a simple random sample (with replacement) from the
Insurance Advisory Bureau (IAB) database, which contains
automobile driver data. The variables available for each database
entry include (among others) driver's gender, age, driving
experience, marital status, and the number of liability claims
made in a five-year period (1990-94). Similar to the Norgas
package, students need to decide on the appropriate sample size
(the simulation can generate 1 to 20,000 entries), where each
record costs $20. This part must be approached with great care as
the data can be obtained only once. Based upon these data, the
task of the student is to determine a method of calculating
insurance premium quotations to maximize Superior Insurance's
gross profit from liability insurance in 1999. Again, the
responsibility is left to the students on how to best obtain and
analyze the data.

<p>To determine how well a premium formulation fares, instructors
can utilize the second simulation in the package. After the
instructor supplies the premium bid formulations for all competing
companies, the simulation can determine each company's gross
profit and thereby determine individual performance. An appealing
feature of this package is it allows student groups within a class
to compete against one another. In the case where students work in
groups, instructors can establish in-class competition by letting
the student groups represent all insurance companies in the
region.

<p>All three bulleted items under the Norgas summary apply here as
well. Unlike the Norgas and Tenderdent packages, the instructor
will need to utilize a C or C++ compiler in order to carry out the
second Superior Insurance simulation. However, all necessary
modification steps are clearly detailed in the author's Technical
Notes and are easy to implement.


<h1>4. Summary</h1>

<p>These are all excellent simulations that are easy to use and
provide a resource of great projects. They are applicable not only
to business statistics classes but also to many applied statistics
courses (including a course in sampling). After reading the
Technical Notes, one will find that Dr. Tryfos has gone to great
lengths to ensure that the simulated data are as realistic as
possible.

<p>What I like most about all three packages is that Dr. Tryfos
incorporates the safeguard feature of allowing only one real run
and that he encourages students to draw their own conclusions. As
he best states:

<blockquote>
 "This type of open-ended project reflects the way real world studies are
conducted and discourages the view that for every problem there is
a unique solution." </blockquote>
