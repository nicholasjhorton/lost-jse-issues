<h2><cite>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</cite></h2> 

by The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Inc. (2000), 
Reston, VA.<p></p>


<p>The new NCTM <cite>Principles and Standards for School
Mathematics</cite> is now available.  Copies of the new
<cite>Principles and Standards</cite> can be purchased
directly from NCTM at their web site (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064015/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/gate/bitslink3.html">http://www.nctm.org)</a>.  The
following excerpt is from the web site's introduction to
the <cite>Principles and Standards</cite>: </p>

<blockquote>With more than 400 content-packed pages, it
delineates six Principles that should guide school
mathematics programs and 10 Standards that propose content
and process goals.  The book features full-color photos and
artwork and includes a coupon for a complimentary CD-ROM
with the fully searchable <cite>E-Standards</cite>, the
electronic edition of the book.…  <i>Principles and
Standards</i> offers vision and direction for school
mathematics programs. The Principles set forth important
characteristics of mathematics programs, and the Standards
discuss the mathematics that students need to know and be
able to do across the grades. The grade-band chapters
(pre-K–2, 3–5, 6–8, 9–12) provide both
specific expectations for those grades and a plethora of
engaging examples to bring those ideas to life.  The
introductory and final chapters describe the broader vision
of the document—introducing that vision and then
setting forth how we need to work together to attain that
vision.</blockquote>

<h2>"The Geometry of Statistics"</h2> 

<p>by David L. Farnsworth (2000).  <cite>The College
Mathematics Journal</cite>, 31(3), 200-204.</p>

<p>The article provides a geometric justification for the
centrality of the arithmetic mean and normal density
function.  The presentation demonstrates that the preferred
measure of central tendency for a given situation (e.g.,
arithmetic mean versus the median) is dependent on the
geometry used to represent the situation and the definition
of distance within the geometry.  This article may provide
a deeper understanding of central tendency, variance, and
density functions for the mathematically sophisticated
student.</p>

<h2>"Discovering an Optimal Property of the Mean"</h2>

<p> by Neil C. Schwertman (2000).  <cite>The Mathematics
Teacher</cite>, 93(4), 304-311.


</p><p>The author describes two activities that illustrate how
to determine the optimal location for a radio transmitter
and for a fire station. The activities are designed to lead
students to discover a unique property of the arithmetic
mean:  the sum of the squared deviations about any point is
a minimum when the chosen point is the arithmetic mean. 
The activities encourage students to use reasoning and
quantitative problem-solving to discover solutions to
practical problems.  Activity sheets are provided at the
end of the article.</p>

<h2>"Using Financial Headlines and the Internet to Keep Statistics Classes Fresh"</h2> 

by Marilyn B. Durkin (2000).  <cite>The Mathematics
Teacher</cite>, 93(4),  318-323.<p></p>

<p>The article provides suggestions on how to use newspaper
headlines and the Internet to help students develop
analysis, research, and writing skills.  Newspaper
headlines that make claims about business trends are
presented in class.  The claims are translated into
testable hypotheses.  Students then search the Internet for
data and information that will address the hypotheses.  The
students learn how to organize the information to produce a
complete picture of the situation, and to decide whether or
not the newspaper claim is justified.  Examples are
provided that address patterns in the Dow Jones industrial
average, the existence of correlations between the DJIA and
other entities (e.g., stock in a company), and the question
of whether one financial indicator is a better market
indicator than others.</p>

<h3>"Statistical Thinking and Learning"</h3> 
<p>by Brian Greer (Editor's Introduction), 1-9.</p>


<h3>"The Longitudinal Development of Understanding of Average"</h3> 
<p>by Jane M. Watson and Jonathan B. Moritz, 11-50.</p>

<p>Abstract:  The development of the understanding of
average was explored through interviews with 94 students
from Grades 3 to 9, follow-up interviews with 22 of these
students after 3 years, and follow-up interviews with 21
others after 4 years.  Six levels of response were observed
based on a hierarchical model of cognitive functioning. 
The first four levels described the development of the
concept of average from colloquial ideas into procedural or
conceptual descriptions to derive a central measure of a
data set.  The highest two levels represented transferring
this understanding to one or more applications in
problem-solving tasks to reverse the averaging process and
to evaluate a weighted mean.  Usage of ideas associated
with the three standard measures of central tendency and
with representation are documented, as are strategies for
problem solving.  Implications for mathematics educators
are discussed.</p>

<h3>"Inventing Data Structures for Representational
Purposes:  Elementary Grade Students' Classification
Models"</h3> <p> by Richard Lehrer and Leona Schauble,
51-74.</p>

<p>Abstract:  This study concerns the development of
children's understanding of data and classification.  Three
intact classrooms of students and their teachers (18 at
1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> grade, 25 at
4<sup>th</sup> grade, and 22 at 5<sup>th</sup> grade)
worked over several sessions to categorize drawings made by
other children and to progressively "mathematize"
their categorization rules.  The goal was to develop a
model that would make explicit their initial guesses about
the grade level of the artists. In small groups, students
developed, applied, and made iterations of revisions to
their data models. The details of instruction and duration
varied somewhat in accord with the capabilities and needs
of students of different ages.  The youngest children
evolved systems of attributes that described their
categories in a post hoc fashion but failed to come to
regard those rules as a model to guide classification.  In
contrast, 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> graders
considered their category systems as models that logically
constrained the members admitted to categories.  These
students came to appreciate dimensional attribute-value
structure, although many continued to include redundant or
extraneous information.  They incorporated and discussed a
variety of kinds of decision rules, including ways of
combining information, such as differentially weighing
diagnostic attributes. By engaging with data characterized
by prototypic rather than crisp membership values, students
had the opportunity to see the intellectual work performed
by practices of data modeling.</p>

<h3>"Controversies Around the Role of Statistical
Tests in  Experimental Research"</h3> <p> by Carmen
Batanero, 75-98.</p>

<p>Abstract:  Despite widespread use of significance
testing in empirical research, its interpretation and
researchers' excessive confidence in its results have been
criticized for years.  In this article, the logic of
statistical testing in the Fisher and Neyman-Pearson
approaches are described, some common misinterpretations of
basic concepts behind statistical tests are reviewed, and
the philosophical and psychological issues that can
contribute to these misinterpretations are analyzed.  Some
frequent criticisms against statistical tests are
revisited, with the conclusion that most of them refer not
to the tests themselves but to the misuse of tests on the
part of researchers.  In accordance with Levin (1998a),
statistical tests should be transformed into a more
intelligent process that helps researchers in their work. 
Possible ways in which statistical education might
contribute to the better understanding and application of
statistical inference are suggested.</p>

<h3>"Assessment in Statistics Education: Issues and Challenges"</h3>
<p> by Joan Garfield and Beth Chance, 99-126.</p>

<p>There have been many changes in educational assessment
in recent years, both within the fields of measurement and
evaluation and in specific disciplines.  In this article,
we summarize current assessment practices in statistics
education, distinguishing between assessment for different
purposes and assessment at different educational levels. To
provide a context for assessment of statistical learning,
we first describe current learning goals for students.  We
then highlight recent assessment methods being used for
different purposes: individual student evaluation,
large-scale group evaluation, and as a research tool. 
Examples of assessment used in teaching statistics in
primary schools, secondary schools, and tertiary schools
are given.  We then focus on 3 examples of effective uses
of assessment and conclude with a description of some
current assessment challenges.</p>

<h3>"Toward Understanding the Role of Technological
Tools in  Statistical Learning"</h3> 
<p> by Dani Ben-Zvi, 127-155.</p>

<p>Abstract:  This article begins with some context setting
on new views of statistics and statistical education. 
These views are reflected, in particular, in the
introduction of exploratory data analysis (EDA) into the
statistics curriculum.  Then, a detailed example of an EDA
learning activity in the middle school is introduced, which
makes use of the power of the spreadsheet to mediate
students' construction of meanings for statistical
conceptions.  Through this example, I endeavor to
illustrate how an attempt at serious integration of
computers in teaching and learning statistics brings about
a cascade of changes in curriculum materials, classroom
praxis, and students' ways of learning. A theoretical
discussion follows that underpins the impact of
technological tools on teaching cognitive and sociocultural
processes.  Subsequently, I present a sample of educational
technologies, which represents the sorts of software that
have typically been used in statistics instruction:
statistical packages (tools), microworlds, tutorials,
resources (including Internet resources), and teachers'
metatools.  Finally, certain implications and
recommendations for the use of computers in the statistical
educational milieu are suggested.</p>

<h3>"Some Class-Participation Demonstrations for Introductory 
Probability and Statistics"</h3> 
<p>by Andrew Gelman and Mark E. Glickman (2000). <cite>Journal of 
Educational and Behavioral Statistics</cite>, 25(1), 84-100.</p>

<p>The authors present classroom demonstrations they use in
an introductory undergraduate course in probability and
statistics.  The activities provide students with
experience in a wide variety of topics that include
estimation, experimental design, survey design, survey
sampling, conditional probability, random sequences,
hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, statistical
power, and multiple comparisons.</p>

<h3>"How Large Does <i>n</i> Have to be for <i>Z</i> and 
<i>t</i> intervals?"</h3>
<p> by Dennis D. Boos and Jacqueline M. Hughes-Oliver (2000).  
<cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 54(2),  121-128.</p>

<p>Abstract:  Students invariably ask the question
"How large does <i>n</i> have to be for <i>Z</i> and
<i>t</i> intervals to give appropriate coverage
probabilities?"  In this article we review the role of
<img width="107" height="40" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./teaching_bits_8_2_files/bits.img1.gif" alt="$\sqrt{\beta_1} (X) / \sqrt{n}$">, where <img width="70" height="40" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./teaching_bits_8_2_files/bits.img2.gif" alt="$\sqrt{\beta_1} (X)$"> is the skewness coefficient of the random 
sample, in the answer to this question.  We also comment on the opposite 
effect that <img width="70" height="40" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./teaching_bits_8_2_files/bits.img2.gif" alt="$\sqrt{\beta_1} (X)$"> has on the behavior of 

<i>t</i>intervals compared to <i>Z</i> intervals, and we
 suggest simple exercises for deriving rules of thumb for
 <i>n</i> that result in appropriate confidence interval
 coverage.  Our presentation follows the format of lesson
 plans for three course levels: introductory, intermediate,
 and advanced.  These lesson plans are sequentially
 developed, meaning that the lesson plan for an
 intermediate level course includes all activities from the
 lesson plan for an introductory course, but with
 additional explanations and/or activities.</p>


<h3>"Spline Bottles"</h3> 
<p>by Thaddeus Tarpey and John Holcomb (2000).  
<cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 54(2), 129-135.</p>

<p>Abstract:  The relationship between the volume of a
liquid in a bottle as a function of the height of the
liquid is used to illustrate polynomial regression and the
fitting of spline models.  A polynomial regression exercise
is provided where students attempt to determine the shape
of a bottle using only the height and volume data from the
bottle. The height and volume data for bottles are easy to
obtain and provide an interesting data-collecting activity
for introducing spline models in a regression course.</p>


<h3>"The Effects of  Active Learning Methods on Student Retention 
in Engineering Statistics"</h3>
<p> by Paul H. Kvam (2000).  <cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 
54(2), 136-140.</p>

<p>Abstract:  An experiment was carried out to investigate
the long-term effects of active learning methods on student
retention in an introductory engineering statistics class. 
Two classes of students participated in the study—one
class was taught using traditional lecture-based learning,
and the other class stressed group projects and cooperative
learning-based methods.  Retention was measured by
examining the students immediately after the course
finished, and then again eight months later.  The findings
suggest that active learning can help to increase retention
for students with average or below average scores.
Graphical displays of the data, along with standard
statistical analyses, help explain the observed difference
in retention between students in the two different learning
environments.</p>

<p><b>"A Look at Statistics on One of Casio's Color Graphing 
Calculators"</b> 
by Margaret Deckman, 1-4.</p>

<p>The article provides a favorable review of the Casio
9850GA PLUS color-graphing calculator.  The author
describes how to perform operations on the calculator that
are commonly used in statistics courses.  In the
conclusion, the author states "I wrote this brief
article to give the readership knowledge that a lesser
expensive yet comparable calculator to the TI-83 exists,
namely the CASIO 9850GA PLUS.  I have enjoyed using it;
they seem to have thought of everything!"</p>

<p><b>"Teaching Probability to Young Children"</b> by 
Cyrilla Bolster, 4-7.</p>

<p>The author describes a simple four-step procedure that
provides an effective way to teach probability to young
students.  The article illustrates how students can use the
procedure to determine whether a game of chance is fair. 
In applying the procedure, students develop a probabilistic
understanding of fairness and explore the role of chance
and random events in determining the fairness of a
game.</p>

<p><b>"Introducing Descriptive Statistics and
Graphical  Summaries"</b> by Brad Warner, 7-8.</p>

<p>The author describes a ten-minute class activity
designed to give students a better understanding of the
roles played by descriptive statistics and graphical
summaries in statistics.  One student is chosen to sit
facing the rest of the class with the instructor standing
behind the chosen student.  The instructor shows the rest
of the class an object.  The class tries to get the chosen
student to make a correct identification by presenting
adjectives that describe the object.  The goal is to use as
few adjectives as possible.  The activity illustrates that
only a few adjectives are needed to identify a complex
object. The result is likened to the use of summary
statistics to describe a complex dataset. A similar game
can be played by using drawings instead of adjectives and
likening the process to graphical summaries. The author
suggests that the activity be performed prior to a formal
treatment of summary statistics and graphical summaries in
order to provide students with a better understanding of
their purpose.</p>

<p><b>"Six Billion Characters in Search of an
Author"</b>  by Mike Fuller, 49-52.</p>

<p>From the Author's Introduction: Because it permeates
such a wide range of topics, people working with statistics
often have to acquire information about, and an
understanding of, topics far from their own. The Internet
is a tremendous resource for finding relevant material on
almost any area.  This article firstly looks at searching
using the Internet.  It then goes on to apply this approach
to finding web based resources about human population
issues—an area in which statistical data and analysis
have a lot to offer.</p>

<p><b>"Bar and Pie Charts: Ideas for the Classroom"</b> by 
Pat Perks and Stephanie Prestage, 52-55.</p>

<p>The authors describe three hands-on activities designed

by focusing student attention on representations of
frequencies and proportions.</p>

<p><b>"Two-Way Interactions: They're Top of the
Pops"</b>  by Vanessa Simonite, 58-60.</p>

<p>The author describes an activity designed to illustrate
a two-way interaction and the risks of specifying too
simple a model.  Students and staff answer questions about
pop music in the 1960's and the 1990's.  Results presented
in the article produced an effect for respondent type, no
main effect for musical era, and an interaction between
respondent type and era.  The author concludes that the
activity provides for quick collection of data, is
interesting and entertaining for students, and illustrates
the main points of two-way interactions quite well.</p>

<h1>Topics for Discussion from Current Newspapers and Journals</h1>

<h2>"In an AIDS Study, the Devil Is in the Details"</h2>

<p>by Jerome Groopman, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 2
April 2000, Week in Review, p. 4.</p>


<p>A recent medical study on sexually transmitted diseases
has raised serious ethical questions. The study, led by Dr.
Thomas Quinn of Johns Hopkins University, was reported in
the March 30, 2000, issue of the <cite>New England Journal
of Medicine</cite>. The research involved 15,127 subjects
in ten clusters of rural villages in Uganda. The aim of the
first part of the study was to determine if the presence of
other sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and
gonorrhea increased the risk of being infected with the HIV
virus.</p>

<p>All subjects were initially counseled on prevention of
HIV, offered free condoms and confidential HIV testing, and
encouraged to inform their partners if they became infected
with HIV. Then, in five of the clusters, subjects were
periodically given antibiotic treatment to reduce the risk
of sexually transmitted diseases;  subjects in the other
five clusters were not given antibiotic treatment. Five
community-based surveys were conducted in intervals of ten
months in order to study to the incidence and progress of
sexual diseases.  The study found that antibiotic treatment
did not decrease the prevalence of HIV, but it did decrease
the number of other sexually transmitted diseases. These
results were reported earlier in an article in the British
journal <cite>The Lancet</cite>.</p>

<p>The <cite>New York Times</cite> article reports on a
second aspect of the study. The researchers initially
identified 415 couples who, at the beginning of the study,
had one partner HIV-positive and the other HIV-negative.
The doctors did not inform the uninfected partners of their
partners' infection.  By the end of a 30-month follow up
period, 90 of the original HIV-negative partners had become
positive. The main finding of this part of the study was
that the "viral load" is the chief predictor of the risk of
heterosexual transmission of HIV. In other words—and
perhaps not surprising—the more virus you are
carrying, the more likely you are to infect a partner.</p>

<p>In a <cite>New England Journal of Medicine</cite>
editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Marcia Angell stated
that a study that withheld treatment for HIV patients and
did not inform their HIV-negative partners would not be
approved in the U.S.  After reviewing the arguments for
having different guidelines for developed and
underdeveloped countries, she continues to believe that
ethical standards should not be different in different
countries.  Dr. Quinn responded by noting that Ugandan
authorities had insisted that only the infected subjects
had the right to tell their partners that they were
infected. In addition, all subjects were given better care,
including antibiotics for such diseases as gonorrhea and
syphilis, than they would have obtained had they not been
part of the study.</p>

<p>These issues bring to mind the Tuskegee study in the
U.S., in which black men who had contracted syphilis were
deliberately not given penicillin so that the researchers
could observe the course of the disease. A major difference
in the present case is that anti-HIV drugs are simply not
available in Uganda.  But whether that fact justifies the
present study is still open to debate.</p>

<h2>"The Politics of Race and the Census"</h2> 

<p>by  Steven A. Holmes, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 19
March 2000, Sect. 4, p. 3.</p>


<p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible
for determining how the federal government collects census
information on race and ethnicity. After extensive hearings
and consultations, the OMB decided in 1997 to include five
categories for race: (1) American Indian or Alaska Native,
(2) Asian, (3) Black or African-American, (4) Native
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and (5) White. They
established two categories for ethnicity: (1) Hispanic or
Latino and (2) Not Hispanic or Latino. The so-called
"minimal standards" require that respondents be offered the
option of selecting one or more racial designations.</p>

<p>The Census follows these standards but allows for more
detailed information.  The first question is on ethnicity
and asks whether or not you are "Spanish/Hispanic/Latino."
If you are, you can then mark a box for (1) Mexican,
Mexican American, Chicano, (2) Puerto Rican, (3) Cuban, or
(4) other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino.  The second question
asks about race. You are asked to select one or more
of the following
categories: (1) White, (2) Black/African-American/Negro,
(3) American Indian or Alaskan Native, (4) Asian Indian, (5)
Chinese, (6) Filipino, (7) Japanese, (8) Korean, (9)
Vietnamese, (10) Native Hawaiian, (11) Guamanian, (12)

(15) Some other race.</p>

<p>Mixed-race couples welcome the changes, since their
children were previously forced to designate a single race.
Civil rights groups had worried that any kind of
"multiracial" categorization would reduce the number
officially recognized as belonging to a specific minority.
In response to political pressure from these groups, OMB
decided that people listing themselves as white and also a
member of a minority will be considered to be of that
minority.</p>

<p>OMB guidelines also clarify the responsibilities of
businesses, government agencies, and educational
institutions that have to report the racial breakdown of
their work force or student body. Rather than requiring
that they provide data on all 63 combinations possible
under the minimal standards, they will be asked to report
the numbers in the five races listed in the minimal
requirements and four racial combinations: (1) American
Indian/Alaskan Native and white, (2) Asian and white, (3)
African-American and white, and (4) American Indian/Alaskan
Native and African-American.</p>

<h2>"Study: Men, Women Differ in Navigating"</h2>

<p>by Malcolm Ritter, <cite>The Boston Globe</cite>, 21
March 2000, C2.</p>


<h2>"Neuroscience: Taxicology"</h2> 

<p><cite>The Economist</cite>, 18 March 2000, p. 83.</p>

<p>These articles provide two complementary views on what
determines people's ability to navigate.</p>

<p>The <cite>Globe</cite> describes a study from the April
issue of the journal <cite>Nature Neuroscience</cite>.
German researchers scanned the brains of 12 men and 12
women as they navigated a virtual reality maze. One
difference that emerged was in the activity of the
hippocampus, an inner brain structure known to be involved
in memory. The brain scans showed men using both their
right and left hippocampi during the task, while women used
only their right. However, women appeared to also use an
outer part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>Earlier studies have indicated that women are more
inclined to use landmarks for navigation, while men rely on
their sense of geometrical direction. The researchers
therefore speculated that activity in the cortex was
related to storing landmarks, while the hippocampus was
related to geometric reasoning. The present study provides
no information about whether the sex differences are
genetic or learned. But the fact that similar differences
have appeared in rat studies was interpreted to mean
that there may be at least some genetic component.</p>

<p><cite>The Economist</cite> describes related results
from the current edition of the <cite>Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences</cite>. Researchers at
University College London compared brain scans of London
taxi drivers to those of a reference group.  Drivers must
pass a rigorous exam on routes through the city to obtain a
taxi badge, which the researchers interpreted as evidence
of superior navigational ability. Since their sample of
drivers were all right-handed males, a reference standard
was constructed by averaging scan results of 50
right-handed "ordinary" men.</p>

<p>The only differences observed were in the hippocampus.
The back of the hippocampus was larger in the taxi drivers
than in the reference group. When the differences were
plotted against years of taxi driving experience, it was
observed that the back of the hippocampus grows and the
front parts shrink over time. This suggests that the brain
may be more physiologically adaptable than neuroscientists
have traditionally thought.</p>

<h2>"The Rankings Game: Mirror, Mirror, Who's the Most
Beautiful of All?"</h2>

<p>by John A. Paulos, ABCNEWS.com, May 2000.</p>


<p>This is from John Paulos' monthly online column "Who's Counting?" at<br>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064015/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/gate/bitslink5.html">http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/whoscounting_index/whoscounting_index.html</a>
</p>


<p>Paulos discusses the volatile nature of the rankings we
find so often in the popular media.  He begins with the
annual list of the 50 most beautiful people published by
<cite>People</cite> magazine (appearing in their May 6
issue). He wonders why so many people who were on last
year's list did not make it this year. In fact, only three
people held onto their spots: actors Ben Affleck and
Freddie Prince, Jr., and singer Ricky Martin. All but 11 of
this year's most beautiful people were actors (18),
actresses (15), or singers (6). As Paulos observes, no
scientist or mathematician made this year's list.</p>

<p>Paulos sees many other examples of high variability in
ratings, such as lists of "best colleges" or "best places
to live."  For example, in the <cite>U.S. News and World
Report</cite> college rankings this year, the per-student
spending on instruction and education-related services was
weighted more heavily than last year. As a result, in the
ranking of "best national universities," Caltech moved from
9th place in 1999 to first place in 2000.  Paulos points
out that institutions don't really change this dramatically
from year to year. He suggests that those who produce these
rankings have an incentive to introduce variability to keep
interest up.</p>

<p>Finally, Paulos observes that, while stock markets have
exhibited high variability of late, news reports can
exaggerate the trends. For example, when the Dow is at
11,000, a 2% drop corresponds to 220 points, which the
news will surely report as a bad day for the market. On the
other hand, he feels that news commentators and market
analysts have their own "most beautiful" internet stocks
whose attraction, as with the most beautiful people, may be
largely based on hype. In any case, Paulos notes that the
businesses themselves don't change as fast as their market
valuations.</p>

<h2>"A Tax on Both Your Poxes: Fed's Report is a Strange Brew"</h2>

<p>by Ken Ringle, <cite>The Washington Post</cite>, 29
April 2000, C1.</p> 


<p>"Gonorrhea Rates Decline with Higher Beer Tax." That is
the startling title of a new report from the Centers for
Disease Control, which investigated the effect of national
alcohol policy over the period 1981-1995. In fact, in 24 of
36 states, higher beer prices were accompanied by lower
gonorrhea rates. But the title reads like a textbook
example of the perils of confusing association with
causation. David Murray, research director of the
Statistical Assessment Service (a resource for science
writers) did not mince words in criticizing the report. He
compared the conclusion to saying that "the sun goes down
because we turn on the street lights." But, as the present
article ruefully notes, the themes of "sex, youth and
alcohol" apparently proved irresistible to the press.</p>

<p>All of this makes one wonder what the CDC had in mind. 
An editorial accompanying their report warned against
jumping to causal conclusions, citing two limitations of
the study. First, reporting practices for gonorrhea differ
across states, making direct comparisons difficult. Second,
it noted that "the analysis may be subject to confounding
effects of unobservable factors. Omitting these variables
could cause substantial bias." Nevertheless, Harold
Chessen, a health economist at the CDC, states that alcohol
use is known to be associated with risky sexual behavior.
He is quoted as saying that the report is "consistent with
the idea that higher taxes can reduce sexually transmitted
disease rates."</p>

<p>Chessen was reportedly amused when asked why the
Prohibition hadn't proved helpful in reducing risky
behavior back in the 1920s. He responded simply that "our
study didn't address Prohibition! I don't know."</p>

<h2>"Oops, Sorry: Seems That My Pie Chart Is
Half-Baked"</h2> 

<p>by Patricia Cohen, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 8 April 2000, B7.</p> 


<p>In her 1985 book <cite>The Divorce Revolution</cite>,
sociologist Lenore Weitzman reported an alarming fallout
from California's no-fault divorce law: divorced women's
standard of living had dropped 73% on average, while that
of their former husbands had increased by 43%. These
figures were widely publicized, and were frequently quoted
in public debate on divorce law for the next decade. But in
1996, another sociologist found that Weitzman's data had
been flawed, leading to an exaggeration of the effect she
found. Divorced women's standard of living had dropped, but
only by 27%; the men's standard had gone up, but only by
10%.</p>

<p>While Weitzman's error appears to have been an honest
mistake in data-processing, such cases raise the issue of
when and how new research findings should be reported to
the public. In the academic world, a research paper goes
through a rigorous process of peer review before it is
accepted for publication in a scholarly journal. But when
the findings are of wider public interest, there is a great
temptation to disseminate them earlier, and stories like
<cite>The Divorce Revolution</cite> are often picked up by
the popular press.</p>

<p>A recent example cited in the article concerns the debate
over school choice. Edward Muir of the American Federation
of Teachers charges that schools are rushing to implement
new education programs whose effectiveness has never been
verified by peer-reviewed research. His critics counter
that Muir is agitating on behalf of the teachers' unions
and questioning only the programs that the unions oppose.</p>

<p>Max Frankel of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science sees peer-review as critical to the
acceptance of scientific results. Still, he acknowledges
that there may be compelling reasons to shortcut the
process, such as "when public health is at stake or
Congress is about to enact a sweeping policy change." Henry
Levin of Columbia University disagrees, noting that "one
study should never make a difference between moving towards
policy or not."</p>

<p>Other social scientists point out that we cannot
reasonably expect that exciting new findings will escape
media coverage.  In light of this, it was encouraging to
ready the following letter to the editor in response to the
article (14 April 2000, A30):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>    Reading [the story] brought back memories of my
    struggles with a required statistics class in my senior
    year at the University of Wisconsin in 1946.</p>

<p>    The one lasting lesson I learned from that class was
    to read every chart, graph and survey result with
    skepticism. There may have been problems with the
    sampling, the questions asked may have been wrong, the
    information misinterpreted, and researchers may have
    made human errors, and so on. Your article reconfirms
    those concerns.</p>

<h2>"Lucky Numbers -- A Casino Chain Finds a Lucrative
Niche: The Small Spenders"</h2> 

<p>by Christina Binkley, <cite>The Wall Street
Journal</cite>, 4 May 2000, A1.</p>


<p>The 1990s saw a boom in casino construction as more and
more states moved to legalize gambling. Harrah's was the
first in many locations, only to see its business eroded by
flashier new establishments. But continuing investment in
ever-more-lavish facilities is an expensive way to compete.
Harrah's has turned to statistics to take a careful look at
its existing customer base, particularly the "small
spenders," with an eye towards improving profits.</p>

<p>Harrah's already had plenty of data available. The casino
had been providing "frequent gambler cards" that customers
presented before playing in order to receive such perks as
free meals, rooms, or show tickets.  Meanwhile, the casino
was collecting information on their gambling behavior. The
original idea was that indexing the give-aways to various
levels of gambling would increase spending, but the results
were disappointing. Then Harrah's chairman Phil Satre got a
tip from Coca-Cola's marketing experts, who suggested
hiring a chief operating officer with a background in
marketing. Satre offered the job to a Harvard Business
School professor named Gary Loveman, who brought
sophisticated market analysis techniques to Harrah's data.</p>

<p>The frequent gambler cards collected data on everything
from where players lived to how fast they played slot
machines. This turned out to be a gold mine for market
research. Some of Loveman's analysis uses the logic of
clinical trials. In one test, Harrah's divided a sample of
frequent slot machine players into two groups. The
"controls" were offered a standard marketing package worth
$125, including a free room, two steak dinners, and $30 in
gambling chips. "Treatment group" members were simply 
offered $60 in chips. Even though the latter was much less
expensive for the casino, it produced more gambling. As a
result, Harrah's has now instituted the new promotion
scheme and has seen it generate more than twice the profit
per person-trip.</p>

<p>Another promotion targeted a group of individuals who
lived near casinos and were identified as "avid gamblers"
by the speed with which they pushed slot machine buttons.
The company tried to encourage back-to-back visits by
making cash and food offers that expired in consecutive
two-week periods. In the target group, the average number
of trips per month jumped from 1.1 to 1.4.</p>

<h2>"If Biology Is Ancestry, Are These People Related?"</h2>

April 2000, Sect. 4, p. 4.</p><p>


</p><h2>"DNA as Detective Again, But on a Biblical Case"</h2>

<p>by Walter Goodman, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 21
February 2000, E7.</p>


<p>The first article discusses the recent use of DNA
fingerprinting to determine the origin of a surname. This
new technique uses the fact that, unlike other chromosomes,
most of the DNA on the Y chromosome is passed on unchanged
from father to son. Mutations can cause small changes in
the DNA.  Such changes are rare, and as they accumulate
they provide a chain that can be followed backwards in time
to trace ancestral lineage. </p>

<p>Dr. Bryan Sykes of Oxford University is an expert in
using this technique to study ancient populations.  
Recently, he has formed a company called Oxford Ancestors,
which is seeking to patent its application of the 
technique to trace surnames. (Further details can be found
in Sykes' research article with Catherine Irven: "Surnames
and the Y Chromosome," <cite>American Journal of Human
Genetics</cite>, April 2000, 1417-1419.)  Sykes has found
that most English surnames have come down from a single
original individual. Historically, surnames appeared in
England between 1250 and 1450, and often identified
trades—Smith is a familiar example. The article
focuses on Sykes' effort to trace his own surname.</p>


<p>Voter registration records list close to 10,000 Sykses in
the U.K., many near a single town in Yorkshire.  Dr. Sykes
sent letters to a random sample of 269 men from three
nearby counties, asking them to send him cells brushed from
their inside cheek on a cotton swab. Bryan received a total
of 61 responses, 48 of which provided usable cells. He
found only one common "DNA signature," which led him to
conclude that there had indeed been a single original Mr.
Sykes.  He also estimated that half of today's Sykses do
not carry this signature, which indicates a "non-paternity
event" in their family histories. (Dr. Sykes himself
carries the original Sykes signature.)</p>

<p>So far Sykes has analyzed three other surnames and found
that each arose from a unique ancestor. He points out that,
if this procedure is found to be successful for other names
and markers, it would have applications to genealogy and
forensics.</p>

<p>The second <cite>Times</cite> article describes how the
technique of using the Y chromosome as a marker has been
used to support the claims of the Lemba people of South
Africa that they have Jewish heredity.  This story was
featured in a PBS broadcast entitled "Lost Tribes of
Israel" (Nova, WGBH Boston, 22 February 2000). PBS has a
web site related to the story:<br>

<p>The same kind of DNA fingerprinting was also used
recently to provide evidence that Thomas Jefferson fathered
a family with his slave, Sally Hemings.</p>

<h2>"Will Juiced Ball Study Yield Fruit?"</h2>

<p>by Dan Shaughnessy, <cite>The Boston Globe</cite>, 11
May 2000, E1.</p>


<h2>"Behind-the-Seams Look; Rawlings Throws Open Baseball Plant Doors"</h2>

<p>by Gary Mihoces, <cite>USA Today</cite>,  24 May 2000, 1C.</p> 


<h2>"Researchers Say Core Has Changed"</h2>

<p>by Hal Bodley, <cite>USA Today</cite>, 26 May 2000,
8C.</p>


<p>In major league baseball this season, home runs are being
hit at a record rate.  If the trend continues, the year's
total will reach 6254, an increase of more than 13% over
last year's record of 5528. Dramatic hitting production
inevitably leads fans to speculate about "juiced" or
"lively" balls.  Baseball commissioner Bud Selig is not
inclined to accept this explanation.  He points out several
other factors that might be involved:  new expansion teams
have diluted pitching staffs, batters are getting bigger
and stronger, and new ballparks are getting smaller. 
Finally, this year umpires have been calling pitches high
in the strike zone as balls, further favoring batters.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Selig does not want to overlook any
possibility. He has asked Dr. Jim Sherwood, a professor of
mechanical engineering at the University of Massachusetts
at Lowell, to investigate whether the balls manufactured
this year still meet major league specifications. 
According to the article, the rule book says that a ball
traveling 100 mph that hits a wall of 2-inch northern white
ash wood is supposed to bounce back at 57 mph.  Test
results from Sherwood's lab will be available later this
year.</p>

<p>The <cite>USA Today</cite> articles provide interesting
background on the manufacture of baseballs.  The first of
these articles describes a tour of the factory in Costa
Rica where all of the balls used in the major leagues are
made.  Rawlings owns the factory and has been the sole
supplier of the major leagues since 1977.  In the factory,
wool yarn and cotton string are machine-wound around a
solid rubber core.  A sample of each day's balls are tested
to measure the "coefficient of restitution" (COR), the
ratio of bounce-back speed to pitch speed in a collision
with white ash.  The article says the major league rule
requires a COR between 51.4% and 57.8%.  Rawlings aims for
the high end of this range and insists there have been no
changes in recent years.</p>

<p>The rubber cores themselves are made in Batesville,
Mississippi, by the Muscle Shoals Rubber Company.  This
company has been the sole supplier of this product for the
entire time that Rawlings has been making the balls (and
supplied Spalding, the previous maker, as well).  A
spokesperson from Muscle Shoals is quoted as saying "We
haven't changed a thing."</p>

<p>But something has measurably changed, according to the
second <cite>USA Today</cite> article, which reports on a
collaboration between Universal Systems of Solon, Ohio, and
the energy laboratory at Penn State. Using a CAT scanner
designed to test cores in the petroleum industry, the
researchers compared the cores used in baseballs in the
1930s with the ones being used today.  A spokesperson from
Rawlings is quoted as saying that the core hasn't changed
over this period, but the researchers report finding
significant differences. Still, they are not ready to say
that these differences are responsible for the home run
surge.</p>
