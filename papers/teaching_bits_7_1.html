<p>This column features "bits" of information sampled from a 
variety of sources that may be of interest to teachers of 
statistics.  Bob abstracts information from the literature 
on teaching and learning statistics, while Bill summarizes 
articles from the news and other media that may be used with 
students to provoke discussions or serve as a basis for 
classroom activities or student projects.  We realize that 
due to limitations in the literature we have access to and 
time to review, we may overlook some potential articles for 
this column, and therefore encourage you to send us your 
reviews and suggestions for abstracts.</p>

<h1>From the Literature on Teaching and Learning Statistics </h1>

<h2>"Random Variables:  Simulations and Surprising Connections"</h2> 
 
<p>by Robert J. Quinn and Stephen Tomlinson (1999).  <cite>The 
Mathematics Teacher</cite>, 92(1), 4-9. 
 
<p>The article presents three activities designed to help 
students develop a working definition of a random variable. 
Students work with coins, a six-sided die, and a decahedral 
die.  For each chance process, students are asked to 
consider theoretical probabilities, work in pairs to collect 
empirical data, and combine data as a class to calculate 
theoretical probabilities.  The activities use tree diagrams 
to explore the behavior of the random variables and to 
encourage students to think about the geometric sequence 
that corresponds to the probabilities.</p>

<h2>"Who's Winning at MONOPOLY Junior?"</h2>

<p>by Donald E. Hooley (1999).  <cite>The Mathematics Teacher</cite>, 92(3), 
197-203.

<p>This article illustrates how a popular children's game can be used
to introduce mathematical modeling and simulation.  MONOPOLY Junior is
a simpler version of the original MONOPOLY game by Hasbro, Inc.  The
article provides information on how to model the game with a computer
simulation, a three-step Markov process, and a random walk to estimate
the probabilities of landing on board spaces and expected values for
the various properties in the games.  The estimates indicate that the
probabilities are not equal and the calculated expected returns are not
always what one expects based on the property values alone.  Students
can work in groups to play the games and record data to test out the
accuracy of the estimates.</p>

<hr>

<h2>"Studying Proportions Using the Capture-Recapture Method"</h2>

<p>by Gregory D. Bisbee and David M. Conway (1999).  <cite>The 
Mathematics Teacher</cite>, 92(3), 215-218.

<p>For anyone who is not familiar with the capture-recapture method for
estimating the size of a population, this article presents a fun way to
learn the procedure by using plain M&M; candies to represents insects.</p>

<hr>

<h2>"Statistics and the Academy Award"</h2>

<p>by Thomas J. Pandolfini, Jr., and Joseph L. Alfano (1999).  <cite>The 
Mathematics Teacher</cite>, 92(3), 219-221.

<p>The authors present a table of data on sixty-nine films that have
won the Oscar for Best Picture.  The table includes data such as the
total number of Oscar nominations, total number of wins, and whether or
not the film had nominations and wins for Best Director, Best Actor,
Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress.  The
article illustrates how this dataset can be used to teach about
empirical probabilities, especially conditional probability (e.g., what
is the probability that a film won Best Picture given that it did not
receive a nomination for Best Director?).  References are provided for
additional information on the Academy Awards.</p>

<h2>"Teaching Statistics Using Humorous Anecdotes"</h2>

<p>by Hershey H. Friedman, Noemi Halpern, and David Salb (1999).  <cite>The 
Mathematics Teacher</cite>, 92(4), 305-308.

<p>This article offers some humorous ways to promote discussion among
your students as they learn about the design of experiments and
surveys.  The authors offer a variety of fictitious anecdotal
vignettes, many of which revolve around a fictitious Professor Ima
Klutz.  The vignettes are short, but rich in detail, and cover topics
such as the representativeness of samples, homogeneity versus
heterogeneity within a sample, response bias due to interview effects
and the wording of questions, the importance of measures of dispersion,
levels of measurement, joint probabilities, reliability and validity,
correlation versus causation, and the appropriate use of inferential
tests.</p>

<hr>

<h2>"Analyzing and Making Sense of Statistics in Newspapers"</h2>

<p>Richard S. Kitchen (1999).  <cite>The Mathematics Teacher</cite>, 
92(4), 318-322.

<p>The author presents two projects that help students to become more
aware of how statistics are used in mainstream news articles.  The
projects are based on articles collected over several months from a
local newspaper.  Articles from the business section are excluded and
only articles that include visual aids such as charts, tables, or
graphs are selected.  In the first project, students work in small
groups to determine how descriptive statistics are typically used in
the news articles.  The assignment asks them to answer questions such
as what type of visual aids are used most often, how the use of visual
aids affects the visibility of the article, and what topics or themes
usually use statistics.  The second project uses specific articles that
are of high interest to students (e.g., university application and
admissions rates as a function of ethnic background). Students are
asked to analyze and interpret statistics and to engage in further
research to resolve inferences they draw from the statistics.  Both
projects are designed to help students develop an awareness of the role
statistics plays in their everyday lives.</p>

<h3>&quot;Developing Case-Based Business Statistics Courses&quot; </h3> 
 
<p>by William C. Parr and Marlene A. Smith (1998).  <cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 52(4), 330-337.</p> 
 
<p>We provide guidelines for developing case-based 
business statistics courses.  Specifically, we describe both 
the benefits and pitfalls of case-based courses, and list 
resources available for course development.  We describe the 
characteristics of the instructor (and the classroom!) 
which augur well for case-based teaching.</p>

<h3>&quot;Designing a First Experiment:  A Project for Design of 
Experiment Courses&quot;</h3> 
 
<p>by C. M. Anderson-Cook (1998).  <cite>The 
American Statistician</cite>, 52(4), 338-342.</p> 
 
<p>A project suitable for use as a first and last 
assignment given in an introductory experimental design 
course is outlined, and its implementation discussed.  Phase 
1 of the project is designed to be given at the beginning of 
a first course in experimental design and involves designing 
an experiment within instructor-specified parameters based 
initially on intuition and common sense.  Phase 2, at the 
conclusion of the course, represents the final assignment of 
the course and encourages the student to critique their 
first design, suggest a "new and improved" design based on 
their newly acquired knowledge, and finally conduct an 
analysis of computer generated data (here using MINITAB, 
although choice of package is flexible) from an actual run 
of their experiment.</p>

<h3>&quot;Correlation, Regression Lines, and Moments of Inertia&quot;</h3>

Is there a similar 
"physical" interpretation of <img width="13" height="28" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064610im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n1/rho.gif" alt="$\rho$">, 
Pearson's product-moment 
correlation coefficient for pairs of random variables?  We 
answer this question affirmatively by showing that <img width="13" height="28" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064610im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n1/rho.gif" alt="$\rho$"> 
is 
equal to the ratio of a difference and sum of two moments of 
inertia about certain lines in the plane.  From this 
observation it is easy to derive familiar important 
properties of <img width="13" height="28" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064610im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n1/rho.gif" alt="$\rho$">. 
Similar results hold for the population 
version of the nonparametric correlation coefficient 
Spearman's rho.  These ideas are readily accessible by 
students in an undergraduate mathematical statistics course.</p>

<p><b>&quot;Exploring Visual Displays Involving Beanie Baby Data&quot;</b> 
 by Bob Perry, Graham A. Jones, Carol A. Thornton, Cynthia W. 
Langrall, Ian J. Putt, and Cris Kraft, 11-13.</p> 
 
<p>The authors describe how a third grade teacher reversed the 
usual didactic of instruction to help students understand 
stem-and-leaf diagrams.  The data used came from the 
homepage of the popular Beanie Baby stuffed animals. 
According to the article, "Instead of taking a set of data 
and showing the children how to construct a stem-and-leaf 
diagram, the diagram was presented and the children were 
challenged to analyse how the data were displayed.  To make 
sense of this unfamiliar display, the children made 
conjectures, justified their reasoning, and validated their 
ideas against the on-going thinking in class."   Examples of 
the children's discussion are presented.</p> 
 
<p><b>&quot;Push-Penny:  Are You a Random Player?&quot;</b> 
 by Mike Perry, 17-19.</p> 
 
<p>The author describes an activity that helps students develop 
an intuitive understanding for the consequences of 
randomness through data handling and the construction of 
graphs and tables.  Students push a coin on a board trying 
to make the coin land on one of five lines.  The lines are 
drawn perpendicular to the push direction, with lines spaced 
exactly two coin widths apart.  The activity allows students 
to explore the behavior of binomial variables and introduces 
them to modeling and inference. 
 
<p><b>&quot;Examples of the Use of Technology in Teaching Statistics&quot;</b> 
by Tom Scott and Susan Jackman, 20-23.</p> 
 
<p>The authors describe the use of Microsoft Excel, graphing 
calculators, and a multimedia computer-based learning 
package (Statwise) in statistics courses at Napier 
University in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p> 
 
<p><b>&quot;THINK: A Game of Choice and Chance&quot;</b> 
 by Ruma Falk and Maayan 
Tadmor-Troyanski, 24-27.</p> 
 
<p>The authors present a modified version of a game (SKUNK) 
introduced by D. Brutlag that they have renamed THINK. 
THINK is a game of chance where players must make 
appropriate decisions to maximize their expected gain.  On 
each round, players choose to either remain in the game 
(trying to earn more points, but risking the loss of earned 
points), or leave the game (keeping points already earned). 
After playing several games, the instructor can ask students 
to make suggestions for an optimal strategy.  Students can 
then calculate probabilities and expected gains to arrive at 
the theoretical optimal strategy, which is then tested 
empirically.</p>

<h1>Topics for Discussion from Current Newspapers and Journals</h1>

<hr>


<h2>&quot;Science and Technology:  Trial and Error&quot;</h2>

<p><cite>The Economist</cite>, 31 October 1998, pp. 87-88.</p>

<p>October 30, 1998, marked the 50th anniversary of the
first clinical trial: the test of streptomycin to treat
tuberculosis.  This article  salutes the tremendous medical
advances that have resulted from clinical  trials
experiments, but also reminds readers of the shortcomings of
this approach.  Four major areas of concern are  discussed.

<p>First, while trials work well for drugs, they are not
easily  adapted to other kinds of treatments.  For example,
it is not clear  how to use them to evaluate psychotherapy
or minor surgery.  For psychotherapy, there is no obvious
placebo for comparison.  For surgery, there are obvious
difficulties with having a placebo group.  However, there is
actually a trial now underway to test  arthroscopic
surgery for knee injuries.  Some doctors feel the surgery
is no better than simply allowing the knee time to heal. 
Patients in the control group will be given a
memory-blocking drug,  and will undergo a minor incision
designed to look like a surgical scar.

<p>Second, since private firms are driven by profits, they
are reluctant to test herbal treatments, which cannot be
patented.  Similarly, there is less incentive to
investigate new uses of a  drug like aspirin, which is now
out of patent but has been shown  beneficial for new uses
such as treating heart attack patients.  Even more ominous
was the 1996 story of a University of California 
researcher who was forced by Boots Pharmaceuticals to
withdraw a  paper because it showed that the firm's drug
for thyroid disease  was no more effective than less
expensive existing treatments.

<p>Third, trials may be conducted under conditions that
will not be reproduced in the outside world, which limits
their relevance.  The article cites a trial called ENRICHD,
which is investigating the  use of psychotherapy to improve
the health of heart attack  survivors who are suffering
from depression.  The concern is that  the quality of care
in the trial is much higher than what can be  expected in
the real world. Such concerns are compounded when  studies
are conducted in poor countries, whose typical standard of 
care is far below anything likely to be experienced in a
drug  trial.  For example, AZT treatment for HIV infection
is seen as  prohibitively expensive for many other
countries. And, as the  article points out, 50 years after
the trial of streptomycin there  are still 3 million annual
deaths from tuberculosis.

<p>Finally, while research initiatives tend to focus on
physiological measures of success, there is comparatively
little emphasis on  quality of the patients' lives.  Hilda
Bastian of the Consumers'  Health Forum of Australia cites
data indicating that fewer than 5% of trials published from
1980 to 1997 measured emotional well-being  or social
function of the participants.</p>

<h2>&quot;Sampling and Census 2000&quot;</h2>

<p>by Morris L. Eaton, David A. Freedman, Stephen P. Klein,
Kenneth W. Wachter,  Richard A. Olshen, and Donald
Ylvisaker, <cite>SIAM News</cite>, November 1988, pp. 1 and
10.</p>


<p>Even the recent Supreme Court ruling has not given the
final word on the use of statistical sampling in the
Census, and the controversy is likely to be with us for
some time.  David Freedman is one prominent statistician
who has consistently raised concerns about the sampling
proposals.  This article, based on one of his technical
reports on the subject, does a nice job outlining the
arguments.

<p>The article begins by pointing out that there are two
proposed uses of sampling for Census 2000.  The first involves
identified housing units from which responses are not
obtained during the mail-in enumeration phase of the
census.  In the past, the bureau attempted follow-up visits
to all of these.  The new plan proposes using a sample of
such residences to estimate the total number of 
non-respondents.  The second use of sampling, called the
Integrated Coverage Measure (ICM), is the analog of the
Post-Enumeration Survey (PES) proposed for the 1990
Census.  It would conduct a nationwide survey to check the
accuracy of the enumeration phase and then statistically
adjust the first phase for under- and over-counting within
demographic groups.

<p>The authors cite the following four general weaknesses with the
proposals:

<ol>
     <li>  Many somewhat arbitrary technical decisions will
          have to be made.  Some of them may have a
          substantial influence on the results.<p>

     <li>  Many of ICM's statistical assumptions are shaky.<p>

     <li>  There is ample opportunity for error.<p>

     <li> The errors are hard to detect.

</ol>

<p>The article provides specific details on all of these. 
For example, on July 15, 1991, the PES estimated an
undercount of 5 million.  However, the authors assert that
50-80% of this figure reflects errors in the estimation
process itself, not in the enumeration phase of the
Census.  Indeed, the Bureau later discovered an error in
its PES analysis which had added 1 million people to the
undercount and shifted a Congressional seat from
Pennsylvania to Arizona!  In any case, the net undercounts
in 1980 and 1990 were in the 1-2% range.  To improve the
count, any new techniques would need to have errors of less
than 1%.  But the authors feel this level is not attainable
with available survey techniques.

<p>The proposed ICM would use a cluster sample of 60,000
Census blocks, representing 750,000 housing units and about
1.7 million people.  Census officials would then attempt to
match data for every residence in the sample blocks to data
from the Census.  An ICM record without a match may
represent a &quot;gross omission&quot; in the Census, that
is, a person who should have been counted but was not,
whereas a Census record without a match may represent an
&quot;erroneous enumeration&quot; in the Census.  Finally,
some people will not be counted either time.  Their
number is estimated by adapting the capture-recapture
method, with Census records being the &quot;captured and
tagged&quot; group, and ICM records being the recapture
group. However, such estimates are flawed by
&quot;correlation bias&quot; because the two groups are not
really independent samples:  people hard to find during the
Census are also likely to be hard to find during the ICM. 
Moreover, even cases that are &quot;resolved&quot; through
ICM field work will still create errors if the respondents
do not provide accurate information.  People who have
moved, for example, may not give accurate information about
their place of residence or household size on the official
Census day (April 1).

<p>The capture-recapture methodology alluded to above
actually needs to be modified because the undercount is
known to differ according to demographic and geographic
variables.  Therefore, the population is divided into
&quot;post strata,&quot; and a different adjustment factor
is estimated for each such stratum. For example, one post
strata might be Hispanic male renters age 30-49 in
California.  The authors object to the &quot;homogeneity
assumption,&quot; under which factors computed from the ICM
are applied to all blocks in the country.

<p>The authors also worry about how the first use of
sampling -- namely sampling to follow up for non-response
in the mail-in phase -- will interact with the ICM
procedure.  One immediate concern is that the ICM sample
will find people who did not mail in their Census forms but
were not chosen for the follow-up sample.  Such people will
be accounted for twice:  once in the ICM adjustment, and
once in the non-response adjustment.  To avoid this, the
Census Bureau proposes 100% follow-up for non-response in
the blocks that will later comprise the ICM sample.  The
authors note that this makes two assumptions:  &quot;(1)
census coverage will be the same whether follow-up is done
on a sample basis or a 100% basis, and (2) residents of the
ICM sample blocks do not change their behavior as a result
of being interviewed more than once.&quot;  Failure of
these two assumptions is called &quot;contamination
error.&quot; The authors state that the magnitude of this
error is not known.</p>

<h2>&quot;Count Monkeys Among the Numerate&quot;</h2>

<p>by Rick Weiss, <cite>The Washington Post</cite>, 23 October 1998, A1.

<p>Over the fall, the story of an experiment showing
that monkeys were capable of counting was widely reported
in the popular press.  It is interesting to contrast the
slant on the story that different newspapers presented. The
Washington Post article attempted to describe the monkey
experiment in the context of a long history of attempts to
demonstrate animal behaviors that correspond to the use of
mathematical concepts such as addition. It provided
quotations from other experts in the field praising the
design of the current study and testifying to the
importance of its results. According to one of the experts,
&quot;This is still an eye-popper for most philosophers and
mathematicians.&quot;


<h2>&quot;No Monkeying About With Numbers&quot;</h2>

<p>by Andrew Derrington, <cite>Financial Times</cite> (London), 7 November 1998, p. 2.

<p>Mr. Derrington is a psychologist.  His article attempted
to provide perspective by relating the achievements of the
monkeys to those of children.  He stated that while
children can tell when two numbers are different, there is
no evidence that they can tell whether one is bigger than
the other until they have learned to talk.

<p>By and large, the popular press did not give a very
careful description of the actual experiment conducted with
the monkeys, as originally reported in <cite>Science</cite>.

<h2>&quot;Ordering of the Numerosities 1 to 9 by Monkeys&quot;</h2>

<p>by Elizabeth M. Brannon and Herbert S. Terrace, <cite>Science</cite>, 23 October 1998,
pp. 746-749.

<p>This research report shows that the experiments were
more complicated than commonly reported in the news. The
monkeys were first trained to order the numbers from 1 to
4.  News reports consistently made it sound like the
monkeys were then able to &quot;count&quot; from 5 to 9. 
However, it turns out that they were not asked to place the
numbers from 5 to 9 in sequence.  Instead they were
presented with all C(9,2) = 36 pairs of numbers drawn from
{1, 2, ... , 9}.  In each case, their task was to order the
pair.  The researchers divided these pairs into three
groups: familiar-familiar, familiar-novel, and novel-novel,
where familiar meant a number from {1, 2, 3, 4} and novel a
number from {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The monkeys performed better
than chance on all three groups, but the novel-novel group
was the most impressive achievement.</p>

<h2>&quot;Six Sigma Enlightenment&quot;</h2>

<p>by Claudia H. Deutsch, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 7 December 1998, C1.

<p>Ask statisticians or probabilists what the phrase
&quot;six sigma&quot; means to them, and the answer will
probably involve the tails of a normal distribution.  In
recent years, &quot;six sigma&quot; has been appropriated
by the business community to refer variously to
methodologies and goals in the area of quality control.

<p>In the Six Sigma model, if one wants to increase the
probability that a product is defect-free, one first
determines all of the steps that are currently used to
produce that product. The present article use the example
of a diagnostic scanner, which is a device used in medicine
to produce images of the inside of the human body. Such a
scanner is of course very complicated to design and build.
In an effort to increase the quality and longevity of the
product, engineers at General Electric Medical Systems
(Gems), broke down their existing scanner into its
component parts, and considered how to design each part so
that it was more reliable.

<p>The next step in the Six Sigma model consists of
considering how much the improvement of each part's design
contributes to the overall quality of the finished product.
Using computers, one can simulate trial runs in which
various possibilities for improving certain parts are
assumed, and then the change in overall quality is
computed. By making many such computer runs, one can
determine which parts are most worthy of attention.  In the
case of the scanner, this revealed several different ways
to obtain the same change in overall quality of the
product. Some of these ways were more expensive and/or more
time-consuming than others. Given such comparisons, the
design engineers were able to make more informed choices
about which parts to concentrate on.

<p>The &quot;six sigma&quot; phrase is widely reported as
corresponding to a production process that produces no more
than 3.4 defects per million. But if one calculates the
probability that a normal random variable takes on a value
at least 6 standard deviations from the mean, one obtains
the value 2 per billion, which is orders of magnitude
smaller than the 3.4 out of one million figure.  The
following explanation seems to shed some light on the
issue.  The six sigma approach deals with the production
process, and does not take into account the fact that raw
materials used in this process are themselves subject to
variation, which in many cases affects the degree of
variability of the finished product.  It is reported that a
value of 1.5 sigma is a good one to assume for the degree
of variability of many types of inputs.  Accepting this
means that one is really striving for 4.5 sigma quality
(4.5 = 6 - 1.5) when one says six sigma. Calculating the
probability that a normal random variable exceeds its mean
by more than 4.5 standard deviations, we obtain the value
3.4 out of one million.</p>

<h2>&quot;College Board Study Shows Test Prep Courses Have Minimal Value&quot;</h2>
<p>by Ethan Bronner, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 24 November 1998, A23.

<p>There has been a long-running debate over whether
students can improve their SAT scores by taking preparation
courses, such as those offered by Kaplan Educational
Centers or Princeton Review. Kaplan advertises that the
average increase in one's SAT scores after taking their
course is 120 points (out of 1600 possible points);
Princeton claims an average increase of 140 points.  The
College Board has long maintained that their tests are
objective measures of a student's academic skills, and that
preparation courses do not improve students' scores.
(Nevertheless, the College Board itself publishes
preparatory material for the tests, explaining that
familiarity with the test styles is beneficial!)

<p>It is not easy to design a study to settle the debate. 
First, the set of people who choose to take preparation
courses is self-selected. Second, those who choose to
enroll in such courses seem to be more likely to employ
other strategies, such as studying on their own to help
them get a better grade. Third, if one takes the SAT test
several times, it is likely one's scores will vary to a
certain extent.

<p>The College Board's own study, undertaken by Donald E.
Powers and Donald A. Rock, is the focus of this article. 
It found that students using one of the two major coaching
programs were likely to experience a gain of 19 to 39
points more than those who were uncoached.  This is
considerably less than was claimed by these coaching
services.  Moreover, since the College Board estimates a
standard error of 30 points for differences in tests taken
at two different times, the study concludes that there was no significant improvement in scores 
due to the coaching.</p>

<h2>&quot;Madison Avenue and Violence Don't Mix&quot;</h2>

<p>by Sally Beatty, <cite>The Wall Street Journal</cite>, 1 December 1998, B9.


<p>A study in the December issue of <cite>The Journal of
Experimental Psychology: Applied</cite> reports that
viewers who watched a violent film clip had poorer recall
of advertising messages than viewers who watched nonviolent
material.  This suggests that violent TV shows may not be
desirable for advertisers.

<p>The study involved 720 undergraduate students at Iowa
State University.  Scenes from ten different movies were
used. &quot;The Karate Kid III,&quot; &quot;Die Hard,&quot;
&quot;Cobra,&quot; &quot;Single White Female,&quot; and
&quot;The Hand that Rocks the Cradle&quot; provided violent
scenes; &quot;Gorillas in the Mist,&quot; &quot;Awakenings,&quot;
&quot;Chariots of Fire,&quot; &quot;Field of Dreams,&quot;
and &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; were sources of nonviolent
scenes. Included with each clip was one of three possible
commercial messages, chosen at random.  One was for Wisk
laundry detergent, one for Plax mouth rinse, and one for
Krazy Glue.  When the students were later tested on
brand-name recognition, brand-name recall, and advertising
message, those who had watched the violent scenes scored
lower.

<p>Professor Brad Bushman, the Iowa State professor who directed the
study, explained that the students who saw the violent scenes
reported feeling angrier.  He reported that such anger appears to
be the major reason people had trouble remembering the ads.
Critics of the study expressed concern about generalizing from
college students to the population at large.  Furthermore, Jim
Spaeth, president of the Advertising Research Foundation,
expressed concern about the use of movie clips.  The research
might say something about the reaction to feature films shown on
TV, but this does not represent the majority of programming.

<p>Bushman countered by saying that all the movies he used
had in fact appeared on television.  As to the first
criticism, he says: &quot;My question is, why would we
expect the memory of college students to differ from the
memory of others?&quot;</p>

<h2>&quot;Ask Marilyn&quot;</h2>

<p>by Marilyn vos Savant. <cite>Parade Magazine</cite>, 3 January 1999, p. 16.

<p>Marilyn's latest response to a probability puzzle could
be used to discuss the distinction between sampling with or
without replacement. In an earlier column (<cite>Parade Magazine</cite>, 29
November 1998, p. 26) she responded to the following
question:

<blockquote>     You're at a party with 199 other guests when robbers
     break in and announce they're going to rob one of you.
     They put 199 blank pieces of paper in a hat, plus one
     marked &quot;you lose.&quot; Each guest must draw a piece, and
     the person who draws &quot;you lose&quot; gets robbed.  The
     robbers think you're cute, so they offer you the option
     of drawing first, last or any time in between.  When
     would you take your turn?
</blockquote>

<p>Marilyn said she would choose to draw first, explaining
that &quot;It would make no difference to my chances of
losing -- any turn is the same -- but at least I'd get to
leave this party as soon as possible.&quot;  Not all of her
readers agreed, and the present column contains responses
from some of them.

<p>One letter argues for drawing first:  &quot;You said any
turn is the same, but I believe that would be true only if
the partygoers all had to replace the papers they drew
before another selection was made.  But if they keep the
papers (the scenario intended by the question), wouldn't
the odds of losing increase as more blanks were drawn?  If
so drawing first is best.&quot;

<p>Another reader argued for drawing last:  &quot;Though
you have a 1-in-200 chance of getting a blank paper and
not being robbed if you go first, the odds are 199 in 200
that the drawing will end with a loser (other then you)
before you draw if you go last.  You should go last.&quot;

<p>In this column, Marilyn restates her original position
that it makes no difference where in the process you draw. 
She argues that the answer would be the same as if everyone
drew simultaneously, in which case it would be more
intuitive that everyone has the same 1-in-200 chance.  She
offers another argument based on people buying tickets for
a church raffle, explaining that it makes no difference
whether you buy your ticket immediately when you arrive or
wait until just before the drawing.</p>

<h2>&quot;Getting it Right on the Facts of Death&quot;</h2>

<p>by Lawrence Altman, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 22 December 1998, F7.


<p>When a patient dies, the doctor is required to fill out
a death certificate specifying the cause of death.  These
death certificates have many important uses.  They provide
information to families that can be important in the case
of hereditary diseases. They may also affect insurance
payments.  From the point of view of research, data on
cause of death influence how policy makers allocate money
for future research, and how researchers themselves assess
the results of medical studies.

<p>Previous investigations of death certificates have found
that a substantial proportion fail to give the correct
cause of death.  A number of reasons have been suggested
for this.  The death may be sudden and the doctor have
little information to go on.  Doctors may be influenced by
family wishes to not have certain kinds of death recorded. 
Also, when several factors are involved, there is a natural
tendency for specialists to see their own area of interest
as the cause of death.

<p>The present article reports on a study focusing on the
accuracy of death certificates with respect to heart
disease.  The researchers considered 2,683 participants in
the Framingham Heart Study who died between 1948 and 1988.
They asked a panel of three experts to examine all the
information available at the time of the deaths and
classify the cause of death as (1) coronary heart disease,
(2) stroke, (3) other cardiovascular disease, (4) cancer,
(5) other, or (6) unknown.

<p>The death certificate gave coronary heart disease as the
cause of death for 942, or 35%, of the deceased;  the
corresponding figure for the expert panel was 758, or
28.3%. For patients aged 85 or older, the death certificate
assigned coronary heart disease for twice as many patients
as did the expert panel. The authors found indications that
when doctors were uncertain of the cause of death, they
listed the death as coronary heart disease. The discrepancy
between the cause of death given on the death certificate
and by the panel was significantly less for cancer, where
there was a longer history to go on.

<p>The authors assert that this level of error has serious
implications for studies that are carried out to test
drugs for treatment of heart disease.  They argue that it
produces a bias towards the hypothesis that the drug is not
effective.

Internal Medicine</cite> online (http://www.acponline.org/).  See

Heart Disease as the Cause of Death,&quot; by Donald M.

<h2>&quot;Fiber Does Not Help Prevent Colon Cancer, Study Finds&quot;</h2>

<p>by Sheryl Gay Stolberg, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 11 January 1999, A14.

<h2>&quot;They Stand by Their Granola&quot;</h2>
<p>by Ginger Thompson, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 24 January 1999, Section 1, p. 33.


<p>Consumers often express dismay at the conflicting health
advice that seems to appear almost daily in the news.  But
one message has seemed clear for many years: a high-fiber
diet is good for you.  One commonly accepted benefit was a
lower risk of colon cancer. This idea originated in a study
done in Africa, where certain groups of people were
observed to have high fiber intake and low rates of colon
cancer.  Still, in the years since this study, many other
studies on this relationship have been undertaken, with
mixed results.

<p>The latest controversy arose from a cohort study
involving more than 88,000 women nurses, who were tracked
over a 16-year period. The subjects filled out
questionnaires that included questions on such things as
amount of physical exercise, smoking, aspirin use, fat
intake, and family history of colon cancer.  After these
data were collected, the subjects were divided into five
groups, depending upon their average daily intake of
fiber.  The null hypothesis -- that there is no
relationship between amount of fiber intake and the rate of
incidence of colon cancer -- could not be rejected for any
of the five groups.  In fact, looking just at the subset of
subjects who ate the most vegetables, the risk of colon
cancer was actually higher by 35% than the overall average
risk.  The authors believe that this last result, while
statistically significant, was probably due to chance. 
They conclude that, although their study does not establish
a connection between intake of fiber and a reduction of
risk of colon cancer, there are numerous other studies that
do show an inverse relationship between fiber intake and
things such as heart disease.

<p>The first <cite>New York Times</cite> article discusses the study, and
the second, the reaction of the cereal industry and shoppers
to the news. The industry rushed to remind customers that
other studies have found that fiber-rich foods are
important for reducing the risk of many other health
problems, for example heart disease and high blood
pressure. Customers generally indicated their mixed
feelings about science and studies. For example, one woman
remarked:

<blockquote>    I feel like most scientific studies are
done in a vacuum. I only listen to the ones that make sense
to me.  There have been many other studies that show high
fiber is good for you for many reasons.

<h2>&quot;The Cancer-Cluster Myth&quot;</h2>

<p>by Atul Gawande, <cite>The New Yorker</cite>, 8 February 1999, pp. 34-37.


<p>Here is one more article on the challenges of
epidemiological research. A &quot;cancer-cluster&quot; is a
geographical area exhibiting an above-average rate of some
cancer.  In the currently popular movie &quot;A Civil
Action,&quot; John Travolta plays the real-life lawyer who
brought suit against W. R. Grace, claiming that the
company's contamination of ground water in Woburn,
Massachusetts, was responsible for the elevated rate of
childhood leukemia there. But how high above normal does
the cancer rate have to be for us to sound an alarm?  And
do neighborhood clusters of cancer always indicate
environmental problems are to blame?

<p>Over the last twenty years, the number of identified
cancer clusters has been increasing dramatically.  In the
late 1980s, about 1500 clusters a year were being reported
to public health officials!  A famous example from the
1980s concerned the farming town of McFarland, California,
where a woman whose child developed cancer found four other
cases within a few blocks of her home. After doctors found
six more cases in the town (population 6400), people began
to fear that groundwater wells had been contaminated by
pesticides.  This led to lawsuits against the manufacturers
of the pesticides.  Nevertheless, despite extensive
investigations of hundreds of such clusters in the US, there
are no cases in which environmental causes have been
conclusively established.

<p>Of course, the failure to identify a cause is profoundly
frustrating for the &quot;stricken&quot; communities. 
Historically, there have been many success stories where
disease clusters were used to identify causes.  Think of
John Snow's famous identification in 1854 of London's Broad
Street pump as the culprit in a cholera outbreak.  In
recent times, AIDS first came to light through cases of an
unusual form of pneumonia.  Moreover, certain occupational
clusters of cancer have led to the successful
identification of carcinogens such as asbestos and vinyl
chloride. But neighborhood cancer clusters are different. 
One reason is that many known carcinogens require exposure
over an extended period of time before they trigger
cancer.  With today's mobile population, it is unlikely
that residents of a community have lived together long
enough for there to be a local cause for their cancers.

<p>What then can be said about the neighborhood clusters? 
They may reflect nothing more than people's tendency to
seek causes for patterns that are perfectly well-explained
by chance variation. The article cites Kahneman and
Tversky's psychological research into people's belief in
&quot;the law of small numbers.&quot;  For example, the sequence
of red-black roulette outcomes RRRRRR is perceived to be
less random than RRBRBB.  Similar misconceptions lead
basketball fans to believe in the phenomenon of
&quot;streak shooting,&quot; even though statistical
analysis fails to find more runs of hits and misses than
would be expected by chance.  The article also cites
probabilist William Feller's famous analysis of bomb hits
in London during WWII.  Because the hits appeared to
cluster, residents suspected that German spies were picking
the targets. In fact, Feller showed that a simple Poisson
model fit the data -- there was nothing in the patterns to
suggest that the hits were non-random.

<p>The article calls the tendency to focus attention on
clusters the &quot;Texas-sharpshooter fallacy,&quot;  named
for the self-proclaimed marksman who shoots at the side of
a barn and then draws bulls-eyes around the holes.  With
cancer clusters, we first observe the cases, and then
circle the at-risk population around them.  The article
quotes California's chief environmental health investigator
as saying that &quot;given a typical registry of eighty
different cancers, you could expect twenty seven hundred
and fifty of California's five thousand census tracts to
have statistically significant but perfectly random
elevations of cancer.  So if you check to see whether your
neighborhood has an elevated rate of a specific cancer,
chances are better than even that it does -- and it almost
certainly won't mean a thing.&quot;</p>
