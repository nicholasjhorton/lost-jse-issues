<h2>"Exploring the Birthday Problem with Spreadsheets"</h2> 
 
<p>by Lawrence M. Lesser (1999).  <cite>The Mathematics Teacher</cite>, 92(5), 407-411.</p>

<p>The author describes a teaching method where students can
explore the birthday  problem without having to engage in
tedious probability computations with a  calculator.  In
the birthday problem, students must determine the minimum
number of people needed (in a room, at a party) to make the
probability at least 50  percent that at least two of the
people share a common birthday, ignoring the  year and not
including leap year days.  A recursive method that
involves point-and-click tabular representation in a
spreadsheet is described that makes  the process manageable
for students.  Using the spreadsheet approach also helps 
students to visualize the recursion process by watching the
probability grow in  the spreadsheet cells or through a
graphic representation.</p>

<h2>"Assessment and Statistics Education:  Current Challenges and Directions"</h2>

<p> by Joan B. Garfield and Iddo Gal (1999). 
<cite>International Statistical Review</cite>,  67(1),
1-12.</p>

<p>Abstract:  The interaction between new curricular goals
for students and  alternative methods of assessing student
learning is described.  Suggestions are offered for
teachers of statistics who wish to re-examine their
classroom  assessment practices in light of these changes. 
Examples are offered of some  innovative assessment
approaches that have been used in introductory statistics 
courses, and current challenges to statistics
educators are described.</p>

<h3>"Making the Grade -- Again<br>
AP Statistics, 1998"</h3>
by Richard L. Schaeffer, 3-5.

<p>In this update to the current status of the Advanced
Placement  (AP) Statistics  examination, the author makes
comparisons between the 1997 and 1998  administrations with
respect to the number of examinations and the nature of the
examination items.  Special attention is given to the
multiple-choice items  which were perceived as much easier
than the open-response items in 1997, and a  special
commentary on the grading of the open-response items is
offered.</p>


<h3>"Sampling and the Census 2000"</h3>
by Lynne Billard, 6-11.

<p>This is a very readable article that can make many
aspects and issues of the  Census 2000 accessible to
students.  The author presents a short historical 
perspective on the Census, exploring changes that have
occurred up through the  present Census.  A large part of
the article explores issues of sampling,  different types
of sampling, and how they relate to the issue of the
undercount. Appendixes are included that discuss simple
random sampling and undercount  calculations.</p>


<h3>"On the Job:  A Day in the Life of a Statistician at
the National Cancer  Institute"</h3>
by Kathleen Cronin, 12-13.

<p>The author describes how her graduate education and
postdoctoral experience led  her to a government position
with the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  She goes on to
describe a typical work day and the types of projects she
is involved in  at NCI (simulating the impact of
mammography on breast cancer incidence;  quantifying
behavioral changes related to diet in the general
population). </p>


<h3>"Ask Dr. STATS"</h3>
by Jerome P. Keating and David W. Scott, 16-22.

<p>Abstract:  Questions about graphing data are frequently
asked throughout courses in Statistics.  The most basic
questions deal with "how to" form density  estimates.  Our
students often inquire about how the smooth density
estimates  are constructed in certain articles and want to
know how to produce such smooth  graphs.  In this article,
we review a fundamental approach in density estimation and
illustrate the procedure on the lengths of home runs hit by
Sammy Sosa and  Mark McGwire in the Great Home Run Race of
'98.</p>


<h3>"Outlier...s"</h3>
by Allan J. Rossman, 28-29.

<p>If you want to provide the more entertaining side of
statistics to your  students, have them read this column. 
The author poses many "assignments" for  students that ask
them to use real world knowledge and their intuition to
match statistics to entities such as newspaper editorials,
text selections from his  favorite authors, and Scrabble
points for the names of famous statisticians.</p>

<h3>"The Ruin Problem via Electric Networks"</h3>
by Jos&eacute; Luis Palacios (1999).  <cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 53(1), 67-70.

<p>Abstract:  Using the electric network approach, we give
a closed-form formula  for the solution of the ruin problem
in the case that the probabilities of  winning a particular
game depend on the amount of the current fortune.</p>


<h3>"Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Nonsingular
Fisher Information Matrix in ARMA and Fractional ARIMA
Models"</h3>
by A. Ian Mcleod (1999).  <cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 53(1), 71-72.

<p>Abstract:  It is demonstrated that a necessary and
sufficient condition for the  Fisher information matrix of
a causal and invertible ARMA to be nonsingular is  that the
model not be redundant;  that is, the autoregressive and
moving-average polynomials have no roots in common.  This
result is also extended to fractional ARIMA models.</p>


<h3>"One-Factor-at-a-Time Versus Designed Experiments"</h3>
by Veronica Czitrom (1999).  <cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 53(2), 126-131.

<p>Abstract:  Many engineers and scientists perform one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiments.  They will continue to do so until they understand the advantages of designed experiments over OFAT experiments, and until they learn to recognize OFAT experiments so they can avoid them.  A very effective way to illustrate the advantages of designed experiments, and to show ways in which OFAT experiments present themselves in real life, is to introduce real examples of OFAT experiments and then demonstrate why a designed experiment would have been better.  Three engineering examples of OFAT experiments are presented, as well as designed experiments that would have been better.  The three examples have been successfully used in an industrial workshop and can also be used in academic courses.</p>


<h3>"Community Service Statistics Projects"</h3>
by Jon E. Anderson and Engin A. Sungur (1999).  <cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 53(2), 132-136.

<p>Abstract:  Statistics instructors know that interesting, real-world problems are crucial to motivate student learning.  As an extension of our efforts to build student interest and ownership in applications, we recently incorporated service learning into our statistics courses.  Service learning provides an active-learning experience associated with a community service application.  In this article we describe our experiences using service learning in our statistics courses.  We give examples of projects used at the University of Minnesota-Morris, a public, liberal arts college.</p>


<h3>"Three Tools for Interactively Visualizing Some Distribution Theory Concepts"</h3>
by Peter K. Dunn (1999).  <cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 53(2), 137-139.

<p>Abstract:  In this article, three Matlab functions are introduced to help students visualize some concepts in distribution theory.  The functions allow the students to experiment with the parameters and views to see the effects immediately.  The three tools cover the area of the central limit theorem, the normal approximation to the binomial, and the bivariate normal distribution.  Some notes on using the programs in the classroom are also given.</p>

<h2>Teaching Statistics, Summer 1999<br>
Volume 21, Number 2</h2>

<p><b>"The BioSS Challenge -- A Demonstration of Sampling
Bias"</b> by Trevor S. Smart,  36-38.</p>

<p>A sampling problem is described which was given to the
general public as part of the Macaulay Land Use Research
Institute's Open Day to illustrate the problems  of bias
and the need for randomization when sampling.  The task is
a variation  on the random rectangles exercise with which
many readers may have familiarity.  The simulation involves
the random placement of clover patches in a field, and 
participants must select a sample of eight to estimate the
average area of a  patch.  The distribution of patch sizes
has a marked positive skew so that small patches are much
more prevalent the larger ones.  Results demonstrate that
the  participants' mean estimates were positively biased
when compared to the true  population mean and mean
estimates based on simple random samples.</p>


<p><b>"Who's the Winner?  An Exercise in Measurement"</b>
by Kathleen M. Shannon and  William S. Weber, 42-45.</p>

<p>The authors describe an activity designed to sensitize
students to the idea that the measurement of an object,
such as the distance between two points, is not  always
uniquely defined.  Students are asked to list, from memory,
the ten  largest U.S. states in order from largest to
smallest by land area.  The student who comes closest to
the correct answer wins a prize.  The main task for the 
students is to determine a method for deciding the winner. 
Students typically  generate several methods.  Discussion
of the pros and cons for each method helps to demonstrate
that a measurement method is not always uniquely defined
for a  situation, and careful consideration of drawbacks is
needed to make a good  choice.</p>


<p><b>"The Graphics Calculator as a Teaching Aid in
Statistics"</b> by Gillian Iossif,  45-48.</p>

<p>The author presents some imaginative ways to use a
graphics calculator to aid  students' understanding of how
to collect data, measure variability, and make  data
comparisons.  In each of these areas the graphics
calculator is used to  teach statistics in an interesting
way, promote understanding, make use of real  data, and
make some aspects of statistics less tedious. </p>


<p><b>"Where do You Stand?  Notions of the Statistical
Centre"</b> by James A. Hanley and  Abby Lippman,
49-51.</p>

<p>The authors describe a simple thought experiment they
call "The Elevator  Problem" which is used to illustrate to
students the decision-theoretic  properties of various
centrality measures.</p>


<p><b>"Overlap Probabilities and Delay Detonators"</b> by Neil T. Diamond, 52-53.</p>

<p>Summary:  A problem in mining engineering concerning
detonators for rock  blasting is considered.  Simple
probability calculations give very useful  information
about the detonation sequence.</p>


<p><b>"The 'Ys' and 'Why Nots' of Line of Best Fit"</b> by Larry Lesser, 54-55.</p>

<p>The author offers suggested responses to students'
questions about why we  minimize the squared deviations to
find the line of best fit instead of other  measures such
as the perpendicular deviations, vertical deviations, or
absolute  deviations.  The suggested responses are not
calculus based and are intended to  offer heuristically
motivated explanations that should be accessible to a 
variety of students.</p>


<p><b>"Rendezvous of the Poisson and Exponential Distributions at the World Cup of 
Soccer"</b> by Singfat Chu-Chu-Lin, 60-62.</p>

<p>The author provides time-series data for goal
occurrences from the 1998 World  Cup of Soccer tournament
and discusses how the measurements can be used to 
illustrate characteristics of Poisson and exponential
distributions.</p>

<h1>Topics for Discussion from Current Newspapers and Journals</h1>

<hr>

<h2>"Getting the Goat"</h2>

<p><cite>The Economist</cite>, 20 February 1999, p. 72.</p>

<p>This article was motivated by a recent scare in Britain
over the safety  of genetically modified foods.  But its
theme is really the difficulty  that people have more
generally when evaluating risks.  It focuses on  three
classic examples of the counterintuitive nature of
probabilities:   the birthday problem, the Monty Hall
problem, and the false-positive  problem.</p>

<p>The version of the birthday problem presented here asks
for the  chance that in a group of 25 randomly selected
people, two or more  will have the same birthday (correct
answer:  about 0.57).  One  respondent at <cite>The
Economist</cite> reportedly said: "I know this.  It's  much
bigger than you think.  One in four."</p>

<p>We will assume that everyone by now knows the statement
of the Monty Hall  problem. Here is <cite>The
Economist</cite>'s explanation for why it makes sense to 
switch doors when Monty offers.  "The point is, your chance
of  winning the car was one in three to begin with -- and
after Monty  reveals a goat, the probability that your box
has the car is still  just one in three.  Because Monty's
choice was not random (he  didn't open just any box, he
revealed a goat) the remaining  probability of two-thirds
gets squeezed, as it were, into the  third box."  But,
noting that "discussions of this point sometimes  prove
violent," the article provides a tree diagram at the
bottom  of the page.</p>

<p>Finally, here is the article's statement of the
false-positive puzzle.   "You are given the following
information. (a) In random testing, you  test positive for
a disease.  (b) In 5% of cases, this test shows  positive
even when the subject does not have the disease.  (c) In 
the population at large, one person in 1000 has the
disease.  What  is the probability that you have the
disease?"  The article states  that most people answer 95%,
when the answer is really 2%.  The  article explains that
in a population of 1000 people, one will  really have the
disease, but another 50 will also test positive.</p>

<h2>"Bottom Line:  Is It Good for You? Or Bad?"</h2>

<p>by Monika Guttman, <cite>USA Weekend</cite>, 26-28
February 1999, pp. 8-9.</p>

<p>How is the public to deal with the many conflicting
health claims that  appear in the media? (A sidebar to this
article is entitled "Would you  like a contradiction with
your coffee?")  A meeting between journalists  and
researchers was organized by the Harvard School of Public
Health and  the Society for Epidemiological Research to
discuss this problem.  The  attendees identified many
sources of blame:</p>

<ol> 
<p><li>  Some peer-reviewed journals now use public
relations firms to  promote their latest issues. 
Similarly, universities have an  incentive to hype their
own research in order to attract more  funding.

<p><li>  The media feel compelled to present what Richard
Harris of NPR  calls the "news-you-can-use angle."  As a
result, "...every little  twitch like oat bran becomes a
huge trend.  Science moves more  slowly."

<p><li>  Scientists may be seduced into overstating their
cases when they find  their work featured in headline news.

<p><li>  The public's obsession with new medical facts
causes incremental  findings to be blown out of proportion.
</ol>

<p>The article concludes that scientists, media, and the
public all need to  be educated about the problem.  And
while a balanced diet and moderation  may not be the stuff
of exciting headlines, they are probably the most 
important message for consumers to hear.</p>

<h2>"Doctors Criticize Placebo Testing:  Mentally Ill
Patients Worsened  After Use"</h2>

<p>by Dolores Kong, <cite>The Boston Globe</cite>, 21 March
1999, A1.</p>

<p>Although viewed as the "gold standard" in medical
research,  placebo-controlled trials are certainly not free
from ethical  controversies.  This article describes the
unfortunate results of  placebo use in three studies of
new anti-psychotic drugs over the last  decade.  Overall,
more than 850 seriously schizophrenic patients were  given
sugar pills instead of existing drugs that were known to
be  effective.  Up to 70% of these patients experienced
deterioration in  their condition severe enough that  they
had to be removed from the trial.  One patient committed
suicide  while on a placebo.  Critics have objected that
the mentally ill are  being used "like lab rats." 
According to Dr. Charles Weijer of Canada's  Dalhousie
University, "This is probably the most harmful ongoing
research  abuse in North America."</p>

<p>In fact, for tests of new drugs, the current FDA policy
requires the  use of placebos rather than existing drugs. 
But a Boston Globe  investigative report last November
highlighted the problems with  this policy in the case of
psychiatric research. In particular, it was  found that
many of the patients enrolled in the study were not
mentally  competent to give "informed consent," since they
could not understand the  implications of being treated
with placebos.  The Massachusetts  Department of Public
Health has responded by suspending two studies  involving
placebos.  Meanwhile, The American College of 
Neuropsychopharmacology, an international research group,
has begun a  debate on drug-testing practices in general.</p>

<h2>"Whitman Says Troopers Used Racial Profiling"</h2>

<p>by Iver Peterson, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 21
April 1999, A1.</p>


<h2>"Profiling Debate Hinges on Issue of Experience vs. Bias"</h2>

<p>by Jodi Wilgoren, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 9
April 1999, B1.</p>


<p>After a long controversy, New Jersey Governor Christine
Todd Whitman and  Attorney General Peter Verniero have now
admitted that some state  troopers did use racial profiling
to single out black and Hispanic  drivers on the highway. 
Verniero released results from a study of the  87,489
motorists who were stopped along the New Jersey Turnpike by
troopers  from the Moorestown and Cranbury barracks during
the 20 months ending in  February 1999.  Of these, 59% were
white, 27% black, and the rest "other" (this includes
Hispanic and Asian).  Data on the population using the
road  were not given.  However, police actions after the
stops show a more  serious pattern of discrimination.  Of
1,193 vehicles searched after  stops during 1996-1998, 53%
were driven by blacks, compared to  only 21% by whites and
the rest "other."  And of the 2,871 motorists arrested, 62%
were black, compared to 33% white and the rest "other."
</p>

<p>The second article shows that the practice of profiling
is not unique to  New Jersey nor to highway patrols.  New
York City's Street Crime Unit  employs an aggressive
maneuver known as "stop and frisk" in its efforts  to find
illegal drugs and guns.  Only a "reasonable suspicion" is 
required for the police to justify such a search.  Critics
argue that  minorities are disproportionately singled out
for such searches.  The  controversy heated up two months
ago when Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West  African immigrant,
was shot to death by four white New York officers.   The
case has led to federal and state investigations into
police behavior  in New Jersey and New York.</p>

<p>Police argue that blacks and Hispanics are statistically
over-represented  in prisons and with convictions on
serious charges, so it is only logical  that they are
stopped more often.  Critics from groups including the
ACLU  counter that this a "self-fulfilling prophecy." 
Stopping and  investigating a higher proportion of
minorities directly contributes to  be a higher proportion
convicted, perpetuating the stereotypes.  Still,  police
maintain that they are not stopping people merely because
of race,  but are keying on situations where an individual
matches the description  of a suspect or a known criminal
pattern.</p>

<p>There have been no nationwide studies analyzing the rate
of stops  and searches by race, but several smaller surveys
have turned up patterns that critics charge can only be
explained by profiling.</p>

<hr>


<h2>"Finance and Economics: A la Mode"</h2>

<p><cite>The Economist</cite>, 27 March 1999, p. 80.</p>

<p>Here is a nice piece on the distinction between the
mean, median, and  mode.  Like the Federal Reserve in the
United States, the Bank of England  sets interest rates to
achieve the Government's target for inflation  (currently
2.5%).  The Bank illustrates its inflation forecast with a 
so-called "fan chart," which shows the inflation rate for
the past five years with the next two years.  The
uncertainty associated with the  forecast is indicated by
various levels of shading around the trend line.   The
darkest shading indicates a 10% probability range, and the 
overall shading is intended to cover 90%.  The shaded
region fans  out to show greater uncertainty farther out in
time, giving the plot its  name.  You can view the most
recent chart at 

<a href="gate/bitslink3.html">
http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/ir.htm</a>

<p>While this may seem like a logical way to illustrate a
probability  distribution, a controversy has erupted as to
how best to draw the fan.   The Bank's procedure has been
to make the bands as narrow as possible for  the stated
probabilities.  To do this, the bands are centered on the
mode  of the probability distribution.  Why not the mean or
the median?  If the  distribution is symmetric, of course,
it doesn't matter.  But if the  risks are more on the high
side -- as the Bank's own data showed them to be  in August
1997, for example -- then the mode would typically be lower
than  the other measures.  Indeed, for the month in
question, there was a 57.4%  chance inflation would fall
above the central (10%) band, but  only a 32.4%
chance it would fall below.</p>

<p>Kenneth Wallis, a well-known British economist, has
criticized the Bank's  presentation and advocated instead
the use of "central prediction  intervals."  The article
presents a chart for August 1997 redrawn to  Wallis's
specifications, using the median and symmetric quantiles
for the  shadings on the fan.  While the Bank's fan is
centered at the goal of 2.5% inflation, Wallis's is
centered close to 3.0%.  The Bank  insists that "policy is
unaffected by how the fan chart is drawn."  But  the
article does not mince words in declaring Wallis's chart to
be more  informative.  </p>

<h2>"To Tell the Truth, It's Awfully Hard to Spot a Liar"</h2>

<p>by Erica Goode, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 11 May
1999, F1.</p>

<p>People tend to be overconfident about their ability to
detect lying.  The  difficulty of this task was illustrated
in research by Psychology  Professor Paul Ekman and his
colleagues at the School of Medicine at the  University of
California in San Francisco.  Ekman made 
videotapes of 10 men, each of whom appears for two minutes
stating his  opinions on a social issue such as capital
punishment.  Some of the men  are telling the truth, and
some of them are lying.  In Ekman's  experiment, subjects
viewing the tapes were asked to identify the liars.   Most
subjects performed only at chance levels or slightly
higher.  Even  professionals who might be expected to
perform well, such as law  enforcement officials and
forensic psychologists, did not clearly  distinguish
themselves.  These findings are consistent with other 
research in the area.  In a meta-study of such experiments,
Dr. Bella  DePaulo at the University of Virginia found that
in 120 such experiments,  only two reported subjects'
accuracy to be greater than 70%.</p>

<p>Ekman has a special interest in "high-stakes" lies.  He
has identified  some people, who he refers to as his
"Diogenes sample," who can regularly  score close to 100%
in such experiments.  He has also found one  occupational
group -- United States Secret Service agents -- who score 
significantly above average.  The best lie-catchers seem to
use groups of  verbal and nonverbal signals to identify
liars, rather than keying on a  single clue such as eye
contact.</p>

<p>One downside noted by Ekman is that some of the groups
who were the best  at detecting lies did not do much better
than chance in detecting  truth-tellers.  This suggests
that they may be overly sensitive to the  possibility of
lies.  Ekman notes that this is problematic in law 
enforcement "because...if you guessed everyone was lying,
you'd be right  about 80% of the time.  The real issue is
how can I teach people not to  make mistakes on those
truthful people, who are accused incorrectly..."</p>

<h2>"Beating Anger: Blowing Your Top Isn't the Same as
Blowing Off  Steam"</h2>

<p>by Judy Forman, <cite>The Boston Globe</cite>, 3 May 1999, C1.</p>

<p>Research reported in the <cite>Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology</cite>  contradicts the popular
wisdom that venting anger is better for you than  holding
it inside.  Brad Bushman of Iowa State University, the
lead  author of the study, constructed a series of
experiments to investigate  this. </p> 

<p>The article does a good job describing the series of
three experiments.  The first involved 360 male and female
college students.  Half were  randomly selected to read a
fake news article explaining the beneficial  effects of
catharsis (i.e., when you are angry, venting your anger in
a  harmless way will make you less inclined toward
excessive aggression later).   The others read an article
explaining that catharsis doesn't work. All  were then
asked to write an essay expressing their position on
abortion. </p> 

<p>Students were then randomly assigned to receive either
positive or  negative comments on their essays, with the
negative comments  designed to provoke anger.  In the final
step of the experiment,  the students were asked to rank
ten activities -- including hitting  a punching bag -- that
they now felt like doing.  Those who were not provoked  did
not want to hit the punching bag, regardless of which
article they  had read about catharsis.  However, of those
who were provoked, those who  had read the pro-catharsis
article were twice as likely to want to hit the  bag as
those who had read the anti-catharsis article.</p>

<p>In a second experiment, 600 male and female students
were again  randomly assigned to read articles pro and
con.  This time, all of  them were given negative comments
on their essays, and they were  then given the chance to
actually hit a punching bag.  Seven women  declined, but
all the others hit the bag!  Each subject was then  paired
with an "opponent" (one of the investigators) for a 
competitive task.  The subject had the opportunity to
behave  aggressively by blasting the opponent with a loud
noise.  The  students who read the pro-catharsis article
were reportedly "twice  as aggressive" as the others.  The
more they had liked hitting the  bag, the more aggressively
they now behaved.  Thus the previous  venting had
apparently not defused their anger.</p>

<p>In a final experiment, 100 students read pro-catharsis
messages  and were then provoked.  This time, instead of
hitting the bag,  they were told to sit quietly for two
minutes prior to the  competitive task.  Their subsequent
behavior proved to be much less  aggressive than that of
the students in the previous experiment.  </p>

<p>The <cite>Globe</cite> article states:

<blockquote>   The research, published recently in the
     <cite>Journal of Personality and Social
     Psychology</cite>, shows that catharsis -- verbal or
     physical venting -- is "worse than useless," says the
     lead author, Iowa State University psychologist Brad
     J. Bushman.</blockquote>

<p>All of this sounds very reasonable, until one checks the
original  research article ("Catharsis, Aggression, and
Persuasive Influence:  Self-Fulfilling or Self-Defeating
Prophesies?"  <cite>Journal of Personality  and Social
Psychology</cite>, March 1999, vol. 76, no. 3, p. 367). 
There the  authors note that previous studies have already
shown catharsis to be  ineffective;  their interest in the
present study was to find out why  catharsis theory is
still so generally believed.  One possible  explanation is
that catharsis is so often portrayed by the media as being 
effective that some people may find it beneficial through
a  self-fulfilling or placebo-type effect. The study was
designed to see if  this is true, and concluded that it is
not.  The researchers wrote:</p>

<blockquote>      Our findings suggest that media messages
      advocating catharsis may be worse than useless.
      </blockquote>

<p>It is curious that the <cite>Globe</cite> article
completely overlooked the media  focus of the study!</p>

<h2>"Election Had Too Many Polls and Not Enough Context"</h2>

<p>by Harvey Schachter, <cite>The Ottawa Citizen</cite>, 5
June 1999, B7.</p>

<p>Schachter complains that newspapers confuse the public
with their  reporting of polls.  He starts by
commenting that polls are  "crude instruments which are
only modestly accurate." The truth is in the  margin of
error, which is "ritualistically repeated in the 
boilerplate paragraph that newspapers plunk about midway
through  poll stories (and the electronic media often
ignore)."</p>

<p>He observes that when the weather forecaster reports a
60% chance  of rain tomorrow, few people believe the
probability of rain is  exactly 60%.  But when a pollster
says that 45% of the voters will  vote for Joe Smith,
people latch on to this number and feel that the poll  was
wrong if Joe gets only 42%.  They also feel that something
is  wrong when two different polls do not agree exactly. 
Schachter gives  examples to show that news reporters, by
trying to supply reasons for  small chance fluctuations in
the polls, often wind up missing the real  reason voters
change their minds.</p>

<p>He concludes by saying:

<blockquote>   It's amusing to consider what might happen if
   during  an election one media outlet reported all the
   poll  results as a range.  Instead of showing the
   Progressive Conservatives at 46 per cent, for example,
   the result  would be shown as 44-50 per cent.

<p>   That imprecision would silence many of the pollsters
   who  like to pretend they understand public opinion down
   to a decimal point. And after the initial confusion, it
   might  help the public to see polls for what they are:
   useful,  but crude, bits of information...</blockquote>
