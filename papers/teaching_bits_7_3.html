<h2>"Teaching the Reasoning of Statistical Inference:  A 'Top Ten' List"</h2>

<p>by Allan J. Rossman and Beth L. Chance (1999).  <cite>The College Mathematics
Journal</cite>,
30(4), 297-305.</p>

<p>The authors state that instructional principles that
have grown from the reform movement in statistics education
have been more readily applied to data analysis than to
the teaching of statistical inference.  To remedy this
situation, the authors offer ten recommendations for
teaching the reasoning of statistical inference.  Each
recommendation is followed by examples of activities and
exercises that illustrate the suggested approach.</p>

<h2>"Using Statistics and Statistical Thinking to Improve
Organisational Performance"</h2>
<p>by S. B. Dransfield, N. I. Fisher, and N. J. Vogel
(1999).  <cite>International Statistical Review</cite>,
67(2), 99-122.</p>

<p>This article may be of interest to undergraduate
statistics majors, students in graduate statistics
programs, and their instructors. </p>

<p>Excerpt from the Summary:  This paper
describes a strategy that seeks to link measurement to all
facets of organisational performance, particularly to
desired business outcomes, and also to mesh measurement
with process improvement in a natural way.  The use of
statistics and statistical thinking is then discussed in
this context, with particular focus on the opportunity for
statisticians to have a key role at the top decision-making
level of the organisation.  We argue that the role requires
skills in both advanced technical statistical modelling and
analysis, and in statistical thinking.  It also requires a
preparedness to form an appreciation of the business and 
management imperatives faced by the leaders of an
enterprise, and  a willingness to work from this basis.</p>

<h2>The Mathematics Teacher<br>
November 1999, Volume 92, Number 8</h2>

<p>This issue of <cite>The Mathematics Teacher</cite>
presents a "Focus on Statistics" with many articles that
should be of interest to the statistics educator.</p>

<hr>

<h3>"<cite>Titanic:</cite>  A Statistical Exploration"</h3> 
<p>by Sandra L. Takis, 660-664.</p>

<p>Abstract:  The tremendously popular movie
<cite>Titanic</cite> has rejuvenated interest in the
Titanic and its passengers.  Students are particularly
captivated by the story and by the people involved.
Consequently, when I was preparing to explore categorical
data and the chi-square distribution with my class, I
decided to use the available data about the Titanic's
passengers to interest students in these topics. This
article describes the activities that I incorporated into
my statistics class and gives additional resources for
collecting information about the Titanic.</p>

<h3>"The Role of Technology in Introductory Statistics Classes"</h3> 
<p>by George N. Bratton, 666-669.</p>

<p>The author states that incorporating technology
(computers or calculators) into introductory statistics
courses does three things: it eliminates the need to teach
certain topics, provides a better way to teach other
topics, and permits the teaching of topics that were not 
possible in the past.  Suggestions and examples are
provided for each of the three areas.</p>

<h3>"The Double Stuf Dilemma"</h3> 
<p>by Marie A. Revak and Jihan G. Williams, 674-675.</p>

<p>The authors describe a sweet activity for testing
whether Double Stuf Oreo cookies actually contain twice the
amount of filling as regular Oreo cookies. In addition to
an activity that will appeal to the students' taste buds,
the authors describe several methodological issues that can
be raised with students that can make this activity a
valuable learning experience.</p>

<h3>"What Is Normal, Anyway?"</h3> 
<p>by Maria E. Calzada and Stephen M. Scariano,
682-690.</p>

<p>The authors state the importance of testing whether data
can be considered to follow a normal distribution before
using the data for inferential statistics.  While visual
displays such as histograms and normal-quantile plots are
useful tools, the authors note that identifying normality
based on these plots is not an exact science. The authors
suggest the Lilliefors test for normality as a more
objective test and illustrate with several examples how the
Lilliefors test can be conducted with a TI-83 graphing
calculator.  The TI-83 program code for the Lilliefors test
is provided in an appendix and is available at the NCTM Web
site.  Modified versions of the code for the TI-85 and
TI-86 can be obtained from the authors.</p>

<h3>"Discovering an Optimal Property of the Median"</h3>
<p>by Neil C. Schwertman, 692-703.</p>

<p>The author uses a practical problem that is faced by many
utilities to help students learn about a property of the
median: What is the optimal location of a central depot
that provides the highest efficiency for distribution of a
good or product? The author describes a set of activities
that help students discover that the optimal point that
minimizes the absolute deviations from the point is the
median.  Six activities are provided, each
one building on knowledge learned in the previous
activity.</p>

<h3>"Secondary Students' Performance on Data and Chance in the 1996 NAEP"</h3> 
<p>by J. Michael Shaughnessy and Judith S. Zawojewski, 713-718.</p>

<p>The authors report on findings from the most recent
National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).  While
the NAEP results indicate that teachers are placing more
emphasis on data analysis, statistics, and probability in
courses, there is still room for improvement given that
three-fourths of twelfth-graders have not studied
statistics or probability in school.  The authors provide
two examples from the 1996 NAEP to illustrate difficulties
that students have when reasoning about data and chance. 
These examples can develop students' understanding of
chance and data through discussion and debate in the
classroom.</p>

<h3>"German Tanks: A Problem in Estimation"</h3>
<p>by David C. Flaspohler and Ann L. Dinkheller, 724-729.</p>

<p>Excerpt from the Introduction: Estimation is covered
extensively in elementary statistics courses.  The example
discussed in this article describes a real-world situation
and a simulation of that problem in which the selection of
a suitable estimate is less apparent.  This problem can be
used at various levels. In a more elementary setting, the
problem is useful to describe the concept of estimation. 
An advanced class can use the problem to discuss
unbiasedness, minimum variance, and best estimates.  At any
level, the problem furnishes an excellent opportunity to
make connections to the social studies curriculum and
demonstrates an application of statistical techniques.</p>

<h3>"Using Simulation on the Internet to Teach Statistics"</h3> 
<p>by Vee Ming Ng and Khoon Yoong Wong, 729-733.</p>

<p>Introduction: This article shares some reflections about
using simulations on the Internet to teach statistics. 
Because Internet  resources keep appearing at a phenomenal
rate, giving a comprehensive listing of all such resources
within an article is impossible.  The authors focus on a
few ideas that are helpful for teaching and learning.</p>

<h3>"Cooperative Teaching Opportunities for Introductory Statistics Teachers"</h3> 
<p>by Deborah J. Rumsey, 734-737.</p>

<p>The author describes how recommendations from the
statistics education reform movement were used to
restructure an introductory statistics teaching program.
Emphasis was placed on using a cooperative teaching
approach to promote both consistency in the way courses are
taught and to support teachers as they incorporate new
teaching methods into their courses.  Two major resources
were developed as the centerpiece of cooperative teaching:
weekly teaching meetings and a teaching-resource notebook. 
The weekly meetings serve as a place to discuss statistical
concepts, present teaching and assessment methods, and
propose new ideas for discussion and feedback.  The author
discusses several different formats for the weekly
meetings, including collaborative presentations.  The
teaching-resource notebook serves as a repository of
examples, experiments and projects, articles and questions
for in-class discussion, and handouts.  Each item includes
an explanation of the intended use in the classroom and
suggestions for assessment.  The article ends with
additional ways to promote teacher involvement and
ownership through collaboration.</p>

<h3>"Data Analysis and Baseball"</h3> 
<p>by Gary Talsma, 738-742.</p>

<p>The author discusses how sabermetrics, a set of
statistical approaches used to gain insights into baseball
through the analysis of numerical records, can provide a
familiar and motivating context for illustrating principles
of data analysis.  Various sources of baseball data are
listed, including periodicals, books, and Web sites.</p>

<h3>"Investigating Distributions of Sample Means on the Graphing Calculator"</h3> 
<p>by Gloria B. Barrett, 744-747.</p>

<p>The author provides examples and methods for using the
TI-83 graphing calculator to help students explore the
sampling distribution of sample means drawn from normally
distributed populations and populations that are not
normally distributed.</p>

<h3>"The Census and Politics"</h3> 
by Barbara Bailar, 8-10.

<p>This article presents background information on the
controversy surrounding the traditional undercount in the
census.  The author indicates many of the important uses
for census data that make the undercount an issue.  Several
issues surrounding the undercount are discussed, such as
the fact that there are overcounts as well as undercounts,
that the undercount does not affect all people equally,
that the adjustments made to the undercount are based on
conjecture as well as fact, and how recent legislative acts
can both facilitate and hinder the processing of census
data.</p>

<h3>"Ear Growth Revisited"</h3> 
by Linda J. Young, RaQwin M. Young, Kristin E. Kelly,
Suzanne R. Kirby, and Beverly A. Kelly, 11-13.

<p>The article describes the research method and analysis
used by two 10-year-old fifth graders to replicate and
extend a study reported in the <cite>British Medical
Journal</cite> on the growth rate of ear length in males
and females aged 30 to 93. The young researchers extended
the research design to answer two questions not addressed
in the original study: Do children's ears grow at the same
rate as adults, and do males' and females' ears grow at the
same rate?  The research method could make for an
interesting class project in an introductory statistics
course, and could promote discussion on the advantages and
disadvantages of comparable research designs (e.g., a
comparison of cross-sectional and longitudinal
studies).</p>

<h3>"AP STATS"</h3>
by Bob Stephenson, 15-18.

<p>The purpose of the "AP STATS" column is to present
fundamental ideas that have come from the teaching of
Advanced Placement statistics courses.  In each column, an
exercise or activity that can be used in the classroom or
as an assignment is discussed, along with the statistics or
mathematics that underlie the topic. This issue's column
addresses why the squared deviations from the mean are
divided by (<i>n</i> - 1) instead of <i>n</i> when
computing the sample variance.</p>

<h3>"From Maris to McGwire: A Statistical View of the
Homerun Race"</h3>  
by Chad Cleaver, 19-21.

<p>The author shows that the Poisson distribution
adequately models the likelihood that "power hitters" will
hit a homerun during a single season.  In the conclusion,
the author discusses extensions of this study that might
provide interesting classroom activities.  Examples of
extensions are testing whether the Poisson distribution is
equally effective in modeling the homerun probabilities of
average players and testing whether models based on the
data for a season provide accurate predictions for the next
season.</p>

<h3>"On the Job: A Day in the Life of a Statistician at
Southwest Research Institute"</h3>  
by Janet P. Buckingham,
24-26.

<p>The author describes how her fascination with numbers
led her to a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics, and
then a job as a Research Analyst at Southwest Research
Institute in San Antonio, Texas.  After 21 years, she is
now a Statistical Consultant for the Institute.  The
position requires her to provide statistical guidance and
analysis for any project that originates within the
Institute.  This provides opportunities to work on a
variety of scientific topics and to use an assortment of
statistical analysis techniques.  In her "typical day," she
describes meeting with engineers who are working on
automotive emissions research, providing the experimental
design and data entry format for a Department of Energy
project, meeting with a colleague to discuss problems he's
having with a one-factor analysis of variance, and
participating in a meeting between Institute personnel and
government engineers regarding the results of a reliability
study of a new magneto-optic inspection instrument.</p>

<h3>"Outlier...s"</h3>
by Allan J. Rossman, 27-29.

<p>In this issue's column, Allan looks into the art of
procrastination and discovers that you can't get away from
statistics, no matter how hard you try. He shows us that
statistics are relevant to playing solitaire on the
computer, viewing videos, and reading both non-fiction and
fiction.  As usual, interesting assignments are posed for
the reader to tackle while procrastinating.</p>

<h2>Teaching Statistics, Autumn 1999<br>
Volume 21, Number 3</h2>

<p><b>"Squaring the Circle -- Statistically Speaking"</b> by P. Glaister, 66-69.</p>

<p>The author describes two games that are similar in form
to Buffon's classic needle problem.  One game involves
dropping a ring onto a surface marked with parallel lines
spaced at equal distances, the distance being larger than
the diameter of the ring.  The task is to determine the
probability that the ring, when dropped, will cross one of
the lines.   A similar problem is described where a
rectangular figure is dropped with the requirement that the
distance between the parallel lines is greater than a
diagonal of the rectangle.  The author offers solutions to
these problems and comparisons of Buffon's needle problem
with the ring and rectangle problems that can be
instructive to students of probability.</p>

<p><b>"Statistical Nuggets with a Graphics Calculator"</b> by Alan Graham, 70-73.</p>

<p>This is the first of two articles that illustrate the
use of the graphics calculator to provide students with
insights into major concepts in statistics. One example
illustrates how the graphing calculator can help
students understand that spurious patterns occur naturally
when generating random values. A second example helps
students learn how changing the class interval size
affects the overall shape of a histogram.  Copies of
worksheets for conducting the exercises are provided.</p>

<p><b>"Young Students' Informal Statistical Knowledge"</b> by Ian J. Putt, Graham A.
Jones, Carol A. Thornton, Cynthia W. Langrall, Edward S. Mooney, and Bob Perry,
74-78.</p>

<p>The articles summarizes results from a study of
students' statistical thinking. In particular, the authors
take a broad perspective and look at the ways students
organise, describe, represent, and analyse data.  Eight
students from two elementary schools in the midwestern
United States were interviewed about their understanding of
bar and tally graphs.  Students' responses to the interview
probes were classified as either idiosyncratic or
higher-level.  One implication of the research is that
teachers can become more aware of the range of students'
statistical thinking by using open-ended questions and
probes like the ones illustrated in the article.  Their
evidence also suggests that students who respond to these
probes demonstrate higher levels of analysis and
interpretation.<p>

<p><b>"The Birthday Problem Revisited"</b> by Jonny Griffiths, 78-80.</p>

<p>The author presents a variant of the classic birthday
problem that presents a good example of the Poisson
approximation to the binomial.</p>

<p><b>"Having a Ball with Confidence Intervals"</b> by James F. Robison-Cox, 81-83.</p>

<p>The author describes a hands-on activity that can be
used as an analogy to the construction and interpretation
of confidence intervals.  The activity takes 30 to 50
minutes and requires props such as tennis balls,
a chalk board, and rulers.  A chalkboard with a thin film
of chalk covering its surface is required.  A vertical
line, which represents the population mean and is labeled
"mu," is drawn on the chalkboard.  Students take turns
tossing a tennis ball at the vertical line.  A horizontal
line is extended for a specified distance from each mark
left by a tennis ball.  This can lead to discussions of how
many intervals cross the vertical line and how to improve
the accuracy and precision of the procedure.  Students'
suggestions are tried until the accuracy is increased to a
90% level.  The author discusses how to draw parallels
between this activity and procedures for constructing
confidence intervals.</p>

<p><b>"On Approximate Calculations"</b> by Flavia Jolliffe, 84-87.</p>

<p>The author argues that while calculators and computers
allow us to focus more attention on statistical concepts,
there are areas in statistics where students benefit from
working through small examples or learning to approximate
calculations in order to recognize when answers are clearly
wrong.  Areas where approximate calculations are helpful
and suggestions for ways to assess students' understanding
and use of approximate calculations are presented.</p>

<p><b>"An Aid to Intuitively Understanding Bias and
Consistency"</b> by Neil H. Spencer, 88-89.</p>

<p>Summary: Students often find the concepts of bias and
consistency hard to understand intuitively.  This article
presents means of demonstrating these concepts using a
computer so that the students, once they have seen them in
action, can more readily grasp their meanings and
implications.</p>

<p><b>"Directional Data" with an Introduction by the Editor</b>, Gerrald Goodall, 90-92.</p>

<p>The editor presents an article that was used to develop
a comprehension question for an A-level mathematics
examination in the UK.  As stated in the summary, "This
article displays some very counter-intuitive problems of
'averages' and shows one area of statistics in which vector
methods play a natural role."</p>

<h1>Topics for Discussion from Current Newspapers and Journals</h1>

<hr>


<h2>"How to Predict Everything"</h2>

<p>by Timothy Ferris, <cite>The New Yorker</cite>, 12 July 1999, pp. 35-39.</p>


<p>Princeton physicist J. Richard Gott III has an
all-purpose method for estimating how long things will
last.  In particular, he has estimated that, with 95%
confidence, humans are going to be around at least
fifty-one hundred years, but less than 7.8 million years. 
Gott calls his procedure the Copernican method, a reference
to Copernicus' observation that there is nothing special
about the place of the earth in the universe. Not being
special plays a key role in Gott's method. In this
interview with <cite>The New Yorker</cite>, Gott explains
how he developed the method, and gives some of its many
other applications.</p>

<p>In 1969, just after graduating from Harvard, Gott was
traveling in Europe.  While touring Berlin, he wondered how
long the Berlin Wall would remain there. He realized that
there was nothing special about his being at the Wall at
that time. Thus if the time from the construction of the
Wall until its removal were divided into four equal parts,
there was a 50% chance that he was in one of the middle two
parts. If his visit was at the beginning of this middle
50%, then the Wall would be there three times as long as it
had so far; if his visit was at the end of the middle 50%,
then the Wall would last 1/3 as long as it had so far.
Since the Wall was 8 years old when he visited, Gott
estimated that there was a 50% chance that it would last
between 2.67 and 24 years. As it turned out, it was 20 more
years until the Wall came down in 1989.  This success of
this prediction spurred Gott to write up his method for
publication. (It appeared in the journal
<cite>Nature</cite> in 1993.)</p>

<p><cite>The New Yorker</cite> has a special interest in
knowing how long various theater productions will run.  On
May 27, 1993, Gott looked up all the shows listed in
<cite>The New Yorker</cite>, including Broadway and
off-Broadway plays and musicals. He called each theater to
find when the shows had opened. He then used his method to
compute 95% prediction intervals for the time they would
close.  Forty-four shows were running at the time, and so
far thirty-six have closed, all at times within his
confidence intervals. Since the others are all still within
the range he predicted, Gott remarks that he is "batting a
thousand" so far!</p>

<p>Gott describes a number of other amusing applications of
the Copernican method. For example, the reason that you so
often find yourself in the longest line at the supermarket
is that there is nothing special about you. You are just a
random person waiting to check out. When you choose a
random person from those waiting to check out you are more
likely to get one from a long line. You can find much of
this discussion on-line in an article Gott wrote for
<cite>The New Scientist</cite> (<a href="gate/bitslink3.html">http://www.newscientist.com/ns/971206/grimreckoning.html</a>).</p>

<h2>"Studies of Leisure Time Point Both Up and Down"</h2>
<p>by Janny Scott, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 10 July 1999, B7.</p>


<p>Do Americans have more leisure time than they used to,
or less?  This article explores why researchers have come
up with contradictory answers. One problem is that
researchers have different methods for trying to answer
this question.  They consider trends over different time
periods and collect data differently -- some relying on
subjects' memories, others on keeping notebooks or
diaries.  In addition, their definitions of leisure time
and work may differ.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is the largest source of
public data on the number of hours per week Americans work.
The Bureau regularly surveys 400,000 non-farm businesses
for the number of hours worked by production and
non-supervisory workers.  The Bureau also regularly
conducts telephone interviews of 50,000 randomly selected
households, asking for the hours worked in the previous
week. Interpreting all of these data is another matter, and
as Bureau economist Randy Ilg points out, "... one set of
statistics will give you one point of view and another
set ... will tell you something else.</p>

<p>Social science researchers have generated their own data
on the subject. In her 1991 book, <cite>The Overworked
Americans</cite>, Harvard economist Juliet Schor reported
that time on the job had increased steadily over the past
20 years.  But a 1997 book entitled <cite>Time for
Life</cite>, by sociologists John Robinson and Geoffrey
Godbey, found an opposite trend. The authors reported that
men and women were working less than they did in 1965 and
had gained an hour a day in free time.  Robinson and
Godfrey asked their subjects to keep notebooks. Researchers
who favor this approach say that relying on memories causes
a bias because people tend to exaggerate the amount that
they work.  Those who rely on the memories of the subjects
counter that using notebooks biases the results in the
other direction, since people who are busy forget to record
some of the work periods.</p>

<p>Some researchers now argue that the average change in
the amount of leisure may be the wrong measure to use,
because there appear to be two different groups of
Americans moving in different directions.  One group
includes baby boomers, who tend to be workaholics with
little leisure time.  The other group, which reports
increasing leisure time, includes older Americans taking
early retirement, and younger couples who start their
families later in life and have fewer children.  Simply
reporting one overall average misses this story.</p>

<h2>"The Courts vs. Scientific Certainty"</h2>

<p>by William Glaberson, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 27 June 1999, Sect. 4, p. 5.</p>


<p>The Institute of the National Academy of Sciences
reported a study which looked at all the studies that have
been carried out to test the effect of silicone breast
implants on women's health.  They concluded that silicone
implants can cause more local problems than have been
previously suggested.  However, they found no convincing
evidence that the implants cause more serious ailments such
as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, as has been claimed in
lawsuits.  More than $7 billion in jury awards and
settlements has already been paid out in these suits.</p>

<p>This article considers the difference between what
scientists require for evidence and what the court does. 
Scientists tend to require evidence at the 95% level. 
There are no deadlines for conclusions to be reached, and
research continues until convincing evidence is produced.
The court, however, does not have the luxury of time;  it
must act at a specific time on a specific case.  In civil
cases, juries are told that a "preponderance of evidence"
provides enough certainty to favor the plaintiff. The
article interprets this as meaning there is at least a 51%
chance that the charges are valid.  But the standard does
not appear to be consistently applied.  In the case of
silicone implants, the court seems to have believed
preliminary evidence backing up the plaintiff's claims, but
it now appears this judgment was faulty.  On the other
hand, until recently it has been difficult for smokers who
developed serious illnesses to successfully sue a tobacco
company, despite overwhelming long-term evidence that
smoking is responsible.</p>

<p>According to this article, some experts feel that we
just have to get used to the fact that the legal system is
not perfect and cannot act like science.  Others say that
the tort system is supposed to be based on the assumption
that you only pay when you have done harm. In rulings
beginning in 1993, the United States Supreme Court has said
that judges should act as gatekeepers and be more vigilant
in assuring that "scientific evidence is not only relevant
but reliable." It remains to be seen what effect these
rulings will have.</p>

<h2>"To Spot Bias in SAT Questions, Test Maker Tests the Tests"</h2>

<p>by Amy Dockser Marcus, <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite>, 4 August 1999, B1.</p>


<p>It has been well-documented that on average black and
Hispanic students score below whites on SAT exams, and
women on average score below men. Critics of the tests
have used these data to charge that the SAT is biased
against certain groups.  In June, the U.S. Department of
Education  Office of Civil Rights began circulating draft
legal guidelines outlining what it considers bias.  One
concern is that colleges using the SAT in admissions may
face legal action because of differences in the scores of
different groups.</p>

<p>The Educational Testing Service (ETS) reports that they
have made every effort to avoid bias and make exams fair to
all who take them.  According to the article,</p>

<blockquote>
      The company tests some questions each year on a
      section of the SAT that doesn't count toward the
      total score and evaluates how students of various
      races and sexes fare in answering them.  If one
      group answers a question significantly better than
      other groups do, the question is banished from
      future tests.
</blockquote>

<p>Here are two examples of questions cited in the article,
one from the verbal section and one from the math.  These
were tried out on students who took the SAT exams in 1998.
The questions were found to be biased and will not appear
on future SAT exams.</p>

<blockquote>
    Verbal
	<blockquote>
	     DUNE : SAND ::
		<blockquote>
	       a. beach : ocean<br>
	       b. drift : snow<br>
	       c. wave : tide<br>
	       d. rainbow : color<br>
	       e. fault : earthquake<br>
		</blockquote>
     Correct Answer: b.
</blockquote>

Results: 23 percent more whites than African-Americans and
    26 percent more whites than Hispanics answered the
    question correctly.<br>

<p>As might be expected from this description, a number of
letters to the editor expressed the opinion that this
analysis of bias was itself unfair.  In response, Paul A.
Ramsey of ETS attempted to clarify the procedure, called
Differential Item Functioning (DIF), as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
       [The DIF process] produces statistics that identify
       large differences in group performance on individual
       test questions; it helps us determine whether these
       differences relate to what the SAT is designed to
       measure (verbal and mathematical reasoning) or
       whether they could be caused by unrelated factors.
       The DIF procedure first matches test takers from
       different groups, e.g., males/females, on the basis
       of their overall test performance, and then flags
       any test question on which these matched groups
       perform in substantially different ways.

<h2>"In Pediatrics, a Lesson in Making Use of Experimental Procedures"</h2>

<p>by Gina Kolata and Kurt Eichenwald, <cite>The New York
Times</cite>, 3 October 1999, Sect. 1, p. 40.</p>


<p>These two articles describe the difficulties surrounding
the evaluation of experimental medical procedures.  The
first is a long discussion of a controversial breast cancer
treatment:  high-dose chemotherapy followed by bone marrow
transplant or stem cell rescue.  Researchers tried for
years to conduct a clinical trial to determine if this
treatment could save lives of patients with an advanced
stage of breast cancer.  But women who believed this was
their only chance refused to enroll in clinical trials,
where there was a chance they would not get the actual
treatment.  The procedure itself is difficult and carries
substantial health risks. It involves harvesting bone
marrow or stem cells from the patient prior to
chemotherapy. The patient then receives massive doses of
toxic drugs targeted at the cancer, but which also destroy
bone marrow. After chemotherapy, the stem cells are
replaced and the bone marrow restored. If successful, the
drugs will have killed the cancer cells, and the restored
bone marrow will grow back before the patient dies of
infection.</p>

<p>This experimental procedure was introduced in 1979 by
Dr. Gabriel Hortobagyi, and by the late 1980's the results
looked promising. Patients with advanced breast cancer who
were given transplants had remission rates of 50 to 60%
compared with the 10 to 15% remission rates
achieved by conventional treatments.  This led to pressure
from Congress and elsewhere for insurance companies to pay
for the expensive treatment, and businesses were
established to provide it. But even as the procedure was
becoming widely used, some cancer specialists began to have
second thoughts. Hortobagyi realized that in the early days
of this treatment, patients had been carefully selected:
they were younger than 60 and free of conditions such as
heart disease or emphysema that would make the procedure
even more risky. The success rate, however, had been
compared with the entire population of women with advanced
breast cancer who were treated with conventional
therapies.  When Hortobagyi restricted the comparison group
to women whose age and overall health matched the
transplant group, he found that the survival rates were
similar.</p>

<p>Last May, results of five studies -- two large clinical
trials in the United States, two large trials in Europe,
and a small trial involving 154 women in South Africa -- were
reported at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology.  In four of the five clinical trials,
there was no difference in survival rates for women who
were randomly assigned to have transplants and those who
were assigned to have conventional therapy. Only in the
South African study did those with transplants do better
than those with conventional therapy.  But a further look
at the South African data showed that those who had
transplants lived about as long as those in the other
studies, while those who had the conventional treatment did
far worse, raising some doubt about the validity of this
study.  The National Breast Cancer Coalition response was
that the data speak for themselves: bone marrow transplants
have been tested and failed. On the other hand, the
American Society of Clinical Oncologists put out a press
release saying that these papers presented "mixed
early results" and more years of study are required. 
However, as remarked earlier, researchers are finding it
difficult to find subjects for such experiments.</p>

<p>The authors observe that, while Federal rules require
that new drugs or devices (such as a heart valve) should be
proven safe and effective before being sold to the public,
medical procedures (such as bone marrow transplants and
surgical procedures) are not regulated by the government.
The authors suggest that this reflects the government's
reluctance to interfere with doctors' practice of
medicine.</p>

<p>The second article explains how pediatric oncologists
have solved this problem in their field.  These oncologists
have organized and have refused to offer experimental
treatments outside of clinical trials. They sponsor only
credible experiments. With their high quality-control they
have been able to persuade insurance companies to pay for
the treatments. While only 1% of adult cancer
patients enroll in clinical trials, 60% of pediatric cancer
patients do.  The article documents some success stories
that resulted from the pediatric oncologists being able to
quickly carry out clinical trials leading to definitive
results.</p>

<h2>"Mozart Sonata's IQ Impact: Eine Kleine Oversold?"</h2>

<p>by Rick Weiss, <cite>Washington Post</cite>, 30 August 1999, A9.</p>


<p>In a 1993 article in the journal <cite>Nature</cite>
(Vol. 365, p. 611), psychologist Frances Rauscher and her
colleagues announced that listening to a certain Mozart
piano sonata produced a temporary improvement in "spatial
IQ," as measured by a portion of a standard intelligence
test. The specific task involved visualizing the shape that
would result if a sheet of paper were cut and folded in
various ways.  Excitement about the "Mozart effect" spawned
a marketing blitz that included a self-help book and
CD-ROMs promising to enhance children's performance on
standardized tests. Catalogs pitched devices to expectant
mothers anxious to broadcast Mozart to the womb. 
Politicians also got into the act -- the governor of
Georgia pledged that the state would buy a classical music
recording for every new baby.</p>

<p>Now Christopher Chabris, a cognitive neuroscientist at
Harvard, has completed a meta-analysis of all 16 previously
published studies on the Mozart effect.  He found little or
no improvement in standardized test scores.  Meanwhile, at
Appalachian State College, psychologist Kenneth Steele has
performed his own study, and similarly reports no evidence
for the effect.</p>

<p>Rauscher and her supporters have criticized Chabris' and
Steele's methodologies, and promise that forthcoming
studies will support the original claim of an effect. 
Steele and Rauscher debated their positions on  a recent
NPR segment.  You can listen to it on-line at

<a href="gate/bitslink4.html">http://www.npr.org/news/healthsci/indexarchives/1999/Aug/990825.02.html</a></p>

<p>Correspondence from <cite>Nature</cite> and a <cite>Psychological Science</cite> 
paper by Steele and his colleagues are available from
Steele's web site

<a href="gate/bitslink5.html">
http://www.acs.appstate.edu/dept/psych/Faculty/Steele.htm</a></p>

<p>Even its supporters concede that the original study was
over-interpreted. The <cite>Washington Post</cite> article
concludes</p>

<blockquote>
    If nothing else, it seems, the rise and fall of the
    Mozart effect may teach the public a lesson about the
    tentativeness of all scientific discovery. If that
    happens, then the incomparable composer will have made
    people wiser after all, if not actually smarter.

<h2>"Cloudbusting"</h2>

<p><cite>The Economist</cite>, 21 August 1999, pp. 69-70.</p>


<p>Seeding clouds to boost rainfall was first attempted in
the 1940s.  Most people are familiar with the idea, and
after all this time it is natural to assume that it has
been proven effective.  But any objective measure of
success requires estimating how much rain would have fallen
without seeding.  This turns out not to be easy, and the
article notes that despite 50 years of anecdotal evidence,
we still lack solid proof that seeding actually works.</p>

<p>American researchers at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR) have spent three years on a
rigorous investigation of a new technique called
"hygroscopic flare seeding."  A hygroscopic compound is one
that attracts moisture.  Salt is an example, and in clouds
over the ocean, rain droplets are known to form around salt
particles.  It seems reasonable that seeding other clouds
with hygroscopic particles would increase rainfall. 
Evidence for this was found in 1988, when a South African
rain researcher named Graeme Mather noticed that emissions
from a paper mill seemed to promote raindrop formation in
the clouds above it. Chemical analysis showed that the
emissions were effectively seeding the clouds with two
hygroscopic salts:  potassium chloride and sodium
chloride.  Mather followed up with a series of experiments
using flares fired from small planes to seed clouds with
hygroscopic compounds.  The current NCAR efforts in Mexico
now aim at reproducing and testing his results.</p>

<p>As noted earlier, researchers needed an experimental
design that allowed comparison between similar seeded and
unseeded clouds.  The following "double blind" protocol was
used.  As a storm develops, a plane seeks out clouds for
seeding.  When one is found, the pilot notifies a
controller on the ground, who opens a randomly chosen
envelope to reveal an instruction card.  The card is
equally likely to say "seed" or "don't seed."  The
controller accordingly tells the pilot whether or not to
ignite the hygroscopic flare.  But the pilot then chooses a
similar envelope of his own, whose instruction card tells
him whether or not to obey the controller's instruction. 
In either case, he continues along the flight path that
would be used for seeding, so the controller is unaware of
his action.  So far, 99 such flights have been completed,
48 of which resulted in seeding.  The results support
Mather's finding that seeding increases rainfall by
30-40%.  Dr. Brant Foote, who oversees the program, points
out that at least 150 flights will be needed to obtain
convincing statistical evidence.  Assuming the effect is
real, the researchers will then need to address the
practical question of whether the extra rain produces
enough economic benefit to justify the cost of seeding.</p>
