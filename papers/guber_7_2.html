<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Using data from the 1997 <em>Digest of Education
Statistics</em>, this teaching case addresses the
relationship between public school expenditures and
academic performance, as measured by the SAT. While an
initial scatterplot shows that SAT performance is lower, on
average, in high-spending states than in low-spending
states, this statistical relationship is misleading because
of an omitted variable. Once the percentage of students
taking the exam is controlled for, the relationship between
spending and performance reverses to become both positive
and statistically significant. This exercise is ideally
suited for classroom discussion in an elementary statistics
or research methods course, giving students an opportunity
to test common assumptions made in the news media regarding
equity in public school expenditures.</p>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>1 In the debate over educational reform there are few
statistics that provoke as much public controversy as the
inequality of school expenditures. Used as a bellwether by
some, money would seem to measure academic quality, or at
the very least, the ability to pay for the resources
children need to learn effectively &#151; for things such as
textbooks and libraries, better teacher salaries, and
state-of-the-art computer facilities. To the extent that
money matters, affluent communities willing and able to pay
high property taxes to finance local schools are pitted
against poorer communities who argue that the prevailing
system is unfair. That argument has met with some success
in recent years. For example, Vermont&#146;s Act 60
attempts to equalize spending across the state using a
&quot;Robin Hood&quot; approach that would raise property
taxes in wealthy towns and use those revenues to better
schools in poorer areas. While such efforts tend to
polarize neighbors and communities into an intense
ideological debate, they do seem to beg one essential
question that is largely empirical: &quot;Does money
<em>really</em> matter?&quot; </p>

<p>2 Intuitively, while it may be difficult to deny the
importance of money and all it can purchase, critics of
educational reform in Vermont and elsewhere often counter
that the amount of money schools spend per student has no
systematic relationship to educational performance. They
argue that it is not money per se that matters, but rather
how wisely those funds are spent, and often they seem to
have an arsenal of statistics to support that claim. As
newspaper columnist <a href="#will">George Will (1993, 
p. C7)</a> bluntly puts it:
</p>

<blockquote>
&#133;[T]he 10 states with the lowest per pupil spending
    included four &#151; North Dakota, South Dakota,
    Tennessee, Utah &#151; among the 10 states with the top
    SAT scores. Only one of the 10 states with the highest
    per pupil expenditures &#151; Wisconsin &#151; was
    among the 10 states with the highest SAT scores. New
    Jersey has the highest per pupil expenditures, an
    astonishing $10,561, which teachers&#146; unions
    elsewhere try to use as a negotiating benchmark. New
    Jersey&#146;s rank regarding SAT scores?
    Thirty-ninth... The fact that the quality of schools...
    [fails to correlate] with education appropriations will
    have no effect on the teacher unions' insistence that
    money is the crucial variable. The public education
    lobby's crumbling last line of defense is the
    miseducation of the public.
</blockquote>

<p>3 For Will, and others, the message is clear &#151; money
simply does not correlate with educational excellence. Or
does it? If there is a case to be made for equalizing
public school expenditures across districts (and even
states), data of the kind George Will cites are especially
troublesome and worthy of a closer look. The objective of
this exercise is to introduce students to this continuing
debate and allow them the opportunity to build their own
conclusions upon a base of solid statistical reasoning.</p>

<h1>2. Classroom Use</h1>

<p>4 This exercise was designed for use in an elementary
statistics course or an introductory class in social
science research methods. The learning objectives are
three-fold: 

<ul>
  <li>First, the exercise allows students to gain
    experience and confidence in using basic statistical
    techniques such as scatterplots, measures of
    association and dispersion, and linear and multiple
    regression. The example works well in that it offers
    students the opportunity to examine a controversial
    issue that is simple to understand and yet surprisingly
    complex to answer. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Second, the exercise encourages students to be
    sensitive to the way in which statistical information
    can be both used and misused to inform political
    argument. In this case, the resolution of the
    spending/performance paradox hinges on students
    recognizing the importance of an omitted variable. By
    failing to control for the percentage of students
    taking the SAT, pundits such as George Will use simple
    and misleading statistics to argue that spending has no
    systematic relationship to academic performance. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Finally, this case should also encourage students to
    explore broader issues of conceptualization and
    measurement. Questions probing these issues might be:
    What level of analysis is appropriate in this case? Are
    data aggregated to the state level adequate to answer
    the question at hand? What are the alternatives? How
    should we measure academic performance? What are the
    relative strengths and weaknesses of using the SAT for
    that purpose?</li>
</ul>

<h1>3. The Dataset</h1>

<p>5 The variables in this dataset were extracted from the
1997 <em>Digest of Education Statistics</em>, an annual
publication of the U.S. Department of Education. Variables
from a number of different tables were downloaded from the
<a href="#national">National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)</a> 
website and
merged into a single data file. While this exercise uses
the most current data available, similar variables are
analyzed in <a href="#hawkins">Hawkins (1994)</a> and 
<a href="#powell1">Powell and Steelman</a> (<a href="#powell1">1984</a>,
<a href="#powell2">1996</a>).</p>

<p>6 Since the data are aggregated to the state level, the
first variable specifies each state by name, in
alphabetical order, allowing students to easily identify
outliers. The next four variables all represent educational
&quot;inputs,&quot; that is, factors that should (but may
not) influence student performance in ways we would expect.
These variables include average annual expenditures per
student, the student/teacher ratio, the average annual
salary for teachers in each state, and the percentage of
all eligible students taking the SAT. Finally, the three
remaining variables in the dataset measure educational
&quot;output&quot; (e.g., performance) using the SAT.
Verbal and math scores appear separately, and an average
total score is given for each state.</p>

<h1>4. Data Analysis</h1>

<p>7 Although some guidance from the instructor is to be
expected, students should be encouraged to examine the data
thoroughly before attempting to resolve the
spending/performance paradox. They should note the general
properties of each of the variables, including their range
and any obvious outliers. They may also wish to rank the
states in ascending or descending order based on their
public school expenditures and/or SAT performance. Do the
same states appear at or near the top of each list? Why or
why not? To answer that question easily, students should be
encouraged the view the relationship between spending and
performance visually in a scatterplot (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Figure 1. Current Per-Pupil Expenditure by Average SAT Score</p>

<hr>

<p>8 As the scatterplot demonstrates, the relationship
between expenditures and performance appears to be
negative &#151; that is, the states that score highest on the
SAT are the states that, on average, spend less money per
student. For example, high spending states such as New
Jersey, New York, Alaska, and Connecticut all post
aggregate scores well below the national average combined
score of 966. </p>

<p>9 These results can be further summarized in a simple
bivariate regression. As the model shown in 
<a href="#Table1">Table 1</a> suggests,
every $1,000 increase in spending per student per year is
associated with a <em>decline</em> of nearly 21 points in
the average statewide SAT score, an estimate that easily
reaches conventional levels of statistical significance 
<nobr>(<i>p</i> &lt; .01)</nobr>. </p>

<p>10 The strength of this relationship might seem puzzling to
students at first. After all, it suggests not that money is
irrelevant to academic performance, but that spending more
on public schools only seems to exacerbate the problem. Or
does it? Just as SAT scores vary widely from state to
state, so too does the percentage of high school students
taking the exam. In fact, participation ranges from a high
of 81% in Connecticut to a low of 4% in Utah. That rate of
participation is determined, in part, by academic interest
in attending college, but also by the preferred
standardized test in that region. As 
<a href="#hawkins">Hawkins (1994)</a> points
out, the ACT remains a popular alternative to the SAT among
college admissions offices in certain parts of the country.
In these states, a select group of bright students intent
on attending competitive out-of-state schools are more
likely to take (and score well on) the SAT. </p>

<p>11 The consequence of this may not be immediately apparent
to the class, but the issue should lead to a lively
discussion. For example, if the very best students in each
state self-select themselves into the pool of test-takers,
the average score naturally rises. Conversely, in states
such as Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and New
Jersey, where a substantial majority of high school
students take the SAT, a less elite population of students
contributes to a lower average score. The strength and
importance of this relationship can be confirmed with a
scatterplot and/or a Pearson&#146;s correlation coefficient
(Figure 2). </p>

<p>12 Does the composition of test-takers influence our
original question relating to school expenditures and
academic performance? Indeed it does. Without controlling
for the percentage of students taking the exam, the
correlation between spending and performance was a
surprising -.381 <nobr>(<i>p</i> = .006).</nobr> However, when a
<em>partial</em> correlation is used to provide statistical
control for this previously omitted variable, the
coefficient reverses to +.391 <nobr>(<i>p</i> = .000).</nobr> (For
greater detail on the use and calculation of partial
correlation coefficients, see <a href="#kachigan">Kachigan 1982, 
pp. 153-155.</a>)
</p>

<p>13 A dramatic improvement in model fit can also be seen in
a second multiple regression model, shown in 
<nobr><a href="#Table2">Table 2</a>.</nobr> With a
robust <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> and slope coefficients that are
both highly statistically significant (<i>p</i> &lt; .01),
it is now clear that while the bulk of variation in
statewide SAT scores is attributable to the percentage of
students taking the exam, increased spending on public
education is in fact associated with better academic
performance.</p>

<p>14 While the analysis presented up to this point is quite
simple to reproduce in the classroom, it should be noted
that this dataset is worth exploring further using more
sophisticated techniques.&nbsp; For instance, if time and
interest permit, students may want to test the importance of
school expenditures in a more complex model. Several
additional variables are provided for this purpose,
including student/teacher ratios and average annual teacher
salaries.&nbsp; </p>

<p>15 The dataset also gives an instructor the opportunity to
address common hazards in regression analysis.&nbsp; For
example, astute students who visually plot the residuals
from the second regression model might question an
irregular U-shaped pattern that clearly hints at a
nonlinearity problem involving the percentage of students
taking the SAT (<a href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a>). Since an
assumption of linearity is key to ordinary least squares
regression estimation, students could be instructed on a
variety of possible solutions, including the addition of a
polynomial term to the equation or a logarithmic
transformation (<a href="#lewis">Lewis-Beck 1980</a>).&nbsp; 
<a href="#powell1">Powell and Steelman</a> (<a href="#powell1">1984</a>, 
<a href="#powell2">1996</a>) address this very issue at some length and
find that the best-fitting nonlinear regression equation is
one that includes both the percentage of test-takers and
its square root, a conclusion that could be tested and
confirmed in the classroom.&nbsp; </p>

<h1>5. Conclusion</h1>

<p>16 As the debate over public school expenditures rages on,
it is clear that simple statistical analyses can mislead
pundits, policymakers, and parents alike. The goal of this
exercise is to encourage students to be acutely sensitive
to these debates and to the way in which statistics are
used to inform various political arguments publicized in
the news media. </p>

<p>17 Aside from that note of warning, however, what
contribution does this dataset make to our understanding of
the public school debate? Do the data conclusively
&quot;prove&quot; that spending more money on public
education produces better results? Hardly, although the
case is instructive in many ways. As <a href="#hawkins">Hawkins 
(1994, p. 26)</a>
warns, &quot;The question of whether money matters in the
public schools is a legitimate research question. In fact,
under the right research conditions, it might be possible
to answer it. Simple correlations based on aggregated data
from the 50 states, however, don&#146;t begin to adequately
explain the complexities.&quot; For example, knowing that
money matters does not solve the riddle of
&quot;when,&quot; and &quot;under what conditions.&quot;
Nor does it tell us how that money should be spent in order
to produce the biggest bang for the buck. In the end, the
strength of this exercise rests not only on what issues are
resolved, but also on the importance of those that
remain.</p>
