<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Statistics educators have previously noted that university students experience some
difficulty in knowing <i>when</i> to use statistical concepts that they have encountered in their
courses. In the present study, statistics educators were asked to rate the importance of
various descriptive and inferential statistical procedures for inclusion in introductory
statistics courses for the behavioural sciences. Items describing research situations and
presenting sample data were written, each item representing a different statistical
procedure. A sample of 23 undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in various
departments in two universities in Melbourne, Australia was presented with these items.
Students attempted as many of these items as they could within a 45-minute period. They
were asked to identify which procedure(s) they considered appropriate for answering the
research question, to justify their choice, to state other choices they had considered and
rejected, to express their level of confidence in their choice, and to rate their
familiarity with the various procedures. Quantitative and qualitative data are reported,
and provide detailed confirmation that the skill of identifying appropriate statistical
procedures in new situations is indeed difficult. Error patterns have been identified that
provide a basis for some alternative approaches to teaching this skill. </p>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<h2>1.1 The Central Problem</h2>

<p>1 The opening sentences of a recent paper by <a href="#quilici">Quilici and Mayer (1996)</a> identify the
central problem being investigated in the present research: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Students in introductory statistics courses are expected to solve a variety of word
  problems that require using procedures such as <i>t</i> test, chi-square, or correlation.
  Although students may learn <i>how</i> to use these kinds of statistical procedures, a major
  challenge is to learn <i>when</i> to use them (p. 144). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#bradstreet">Bradstreet (1996)</a> makes a similar observation: statistics students &quot;often are able
to manipulate definitions and algorithms with apparent competence, and yet not reveal, to
their teachers or themselves, that they would not know what to do if faced with a real
world problem&quot; (p. 73). </p>

<p>2 <a href="#schau">Schau and Mattern (1997)</a> offer a more elaborate exposition of the same idea: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We, and many other statistics instructors, routinely observe a critical weakness in
  post-secondary students who have taken applied statistics courses: they lack understanding
  of the connections among the important, functional concepts in the discipline. Without
  understanding these concepts, students cannot effectively and efficiently engage in
  statistical reasoning and problem-solving. They remain novices. They have
  &quot;isolated&quot; knowledge about various concepts; for example, they may be able to
  calculate a standard deviation and a standard error. However, they do not understand how
  these concepts are related (and distinguished) and so make application errors, such as
  using one concept when they should have used the other. Some students recognize their lack
  of connected understanding and will say things like &quot;I can solve a problem using the
  t-test when I know I'm supposed to. But otherwise I don't have a clue&quot; (p. 91). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>3 We label this difficulty as the problem of <i>learning to apply statistics</i>, i.e., the
problem of developing the capability of selecting statistical tests and procedures which
are appropriate for analysing data in any given research situation. <a href="#ware2">Ware and Chastain
(1991)</a> have previously labelled this capability <i>selection skill</i>. </p>

<h2>1.2 The Importance of the Capability</h2>

<p>4 <a href="#anderson_cw">Anderson and Loynes (1987)</a>, in a book on the teaching of statistics, observe that
&quot;concern with the skills needed to apply theoretical knowledge to real problems has
never received much attention&quot;; these authors argue that statistical training ought
not to &quot;ignore the problem of making real connections with practice&quot; (p. ix).
Their book devotes a chapter to the aims of statistics education that presents a
systematic listing of general abilities which a statistics course might be expected to
develop. Some aims are non-technical (e.g., &quot;to work successfully with others&quot;);
some are partly technical (&quot;to determine the aims of an investigation and its
framework, e.g., how the data are defined and collected&quot;). Others are technical:
&quot;to recognise which techniques are valid and/or appropriate&quot; (pp. 20-24). </p>

<p>5 It is the assessment of this aim that is the focus of the present study. We recognise
that this is a narrow focus, and that the ability to apply an appropriate statistical
procedure to a research problem is only one of many capabilities that a university course
in statistics would seek to achieve. Nevertheless, we regard it as an important
capability, especially for those students who wish to undertake quantitative research in
their field. <a href="#ware2">Ware and Chastain (1991)</a>, whose research is discussed in more detail below,
argue that selection skills are important if students are to use the information in a
statistics textbook effectively. </p>

<p>6 With that said, we recognise that the problem of learning to apply statistics should
not be regarded as isolated or easily separable from the wider and more challenging issues
involved in teaching statistics effectively. <a href="#snee">Snee (1993)</a> argues that ways must be found to
make the teaching and learning of statistics more relevant and meaningful; others have
noted that many students experience emotional reactions when encountering statistics
courses. The preface to a recent and innovative textbook (<a href="#diekhoff">Diekhoff 1996</a>) expresses well
some of the affective aspects of beginning the learning of statistics: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After nearly 20 years of teaching statistics I can count on one hand the students who
  took the course as an elective! Indeed, the common denominator of students beginning their
  study of statistics is dread. I understand this. I haven't forgotten the confusion and
  frustration that I felt as I struggled through my own first course in statistics (p. xv). </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>1.3 Previous Research</h2>

<p>7 <a href="#garfield">Garfield and Ahlgren (1988)</a> review numerous studies showing that students have
difficulty in using statistical reasoning and in solving statistics problems even after
exposure to instruction. However, research in the area is rare. <a href="#ware2">Ware and Chastain (1991)</a>
comment that &quot;the literature on teaching statistics is sparse&quot; (p. 219), while
<a href="#shaughnessy">Shaughnessy (1992)</a> in his masterly overview of research in probability and statistics
notes the low level of involvement of North American mathematics educators in research on
teaching and learning in this field. </p>

<p>8 Few studies have been found which provide evidence on students' difficulties with
applying statistical procedures to new situations. <a href="#ware1">Ware and Chastain (1989)</a> compared
students learning statistics with the aid of a computer-based teaching program with a
&quot;traditional&quot; group. Various cognitive and affective measures were employed,
among them a multiple-choice test of selection skills. A typical item would present a
research situation, sample data, and a statement of the research question, followed by
four multiple-choice options listing various statistical procedures. No significant
difference was found between the two groups. What is noteworthy is the relatively poor
performance of both groups: a mean of 3.7 (out of 10 items) for the computer group, 3.2
for the traditional. (Random guessing would lead to an expected mean score of 2.5.) The
authors note that the low scores might </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>reflect teachers' failure to emphasize selection skills. A common practice is to teach
  statistical tests one at a time. We know of only a handful of introductory statistics
  teachers who expect students to select appropriate statistical tests for a variety of
  circumstances. Some might argue that teaching selection skills is not central to a
  statistics course because students can select the proper test from a book. However, the
  absence of guidelines for selecting suitable statistical tests can limit the effective use
  of a book (p. 226). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>9 In a later study, <a href="#ware2">Ware and Chastain (1991)</a> employed a similar test (with only eight
items) to evaluate the effect of deliberately teaching selection skills to students. A
class in which the instructor emphasised selection skills performed significantly better
than a control class not exposed to such emphasis. Widespread use of computers in
statistics, these authors noted, had minimised the need for teachers to demonstrate
computational procedures. Teachers might therefore &quot;better use the available time for
teaching students when to use a test, rather than simply teaching computational procedures
and statistical tests one after another&quot; (p. 219). The authors also reported (not
surprisingly) that students with higher grade point averages performed better on the test.
</p>

<p>10 More recently, <a href="#quilici">Quilici and Mayer (1996)</a> conducted an experimental study of how
students categorise statistics word problems, with the content of the stimulus material
carefully controlled. Their twelve items consisted of four research situations (involving
the weather, typing, mental fatigue, and reading) crossed with three types of appropriate
statistical test (t-test, chi-squared, correlation). Their study focussed on the ways in
which students drew upon knowledge of prior examples to categorise the stimulus items.
These researchers argued that students need to learn how to &quot;ignore the cover story
in word problems and instead focus on the experimental design and whether the variables
are quantitative or categorical&quot; (p. 158). (We would comment that it is not so much a
matter of ignoring the cover story, since data always have to be understood within a
realistic context; rather, it is a matter of educating students not to be misled by
irrelevant information in the cover story.) </p>

<h1>2. Design of the Present Study</h1>

<h2>2.1 Context</h2>

<p>11 The present study was an investigation of the capabilities of students in the
behavioural sciences (e.g., psychology, education, nursing education) who have studied
statistics subjects, sometimes for one or two semesters but most frequently for three
years, as part of their program. For these students, statistics is an applied discipline,
a tool for understanding research literature and perhaps (later) conducting their own
research, rather than a &quot;pure&quot; academic discipline in its own right. The
statistics courses they have taken invariably include basic descriptive statistics
(measures of central tendency, variability, correlation) and varying amounts of
inferential statistics. These courses generally aim to develop students' computational
skills, sometimes with conceptual understanding of underlying theory and sometimes
without, sometimes through the use of computer packages and sometimes not. </p>

<h2>2.2 The Design of the Present Study</h2>

<p>12 Our study resembles those of <a href="#ware1">Ware and Chastain (1989, 1991)</a> and <a href="#quilici">Quilici and Mayer
(1996)</a> in some respects, but differs from them in others. Our aim was similar: to
investigate how well students who were presented with a description of a research problem
could select an appropriate statistical procedure for analysing it. The stimulus materials
were also similar: the earlier researchers also presented students with a set of items
describing various research situations and data. In other respects, the studies differ.
The Ware and Chastain studies utilised a multiple-choice test; this is a convenient and
objective method, but it lacks authenticity, since real-world research problems do not
come packaged with multiple-choice answers. The Quilici and Mayer study reported an
experiment in which characteristics of the stimulus materials were carefully controlled;
their set of stimulus items covered only three statistical tests, a consequence of their
experimental design; like Ware and Chastain, they employed objective data-gathering
procedures which focussed on behavioural outcomes (sorting sets of cards, selecting a
statistical test). In the present study, in contrast, we investigated students' ability to
categorise a wide range of statistical situations. Students were required to recall rather
than recognise an appropriate test. </p>

<p>13 We consider that a crucial behavioural indicator of the capacity to categorise is
the ability to <b>name</b> a statistical procedure which is appropriate for a given research
situation. This ability is considered important, since it is a prerequisite for looking up
an appropriate formula in a statistics text, or for selecting an appropriate procedure
from the menu of a computer package. In the present study, qualitative (structured
interview) as well as quantitative methods were employed in an attempt to explore the
reasoning processes which students used to justify their selection and to identify the
nature of the difficulties that they displayed in grappling with the task. </p>

<h2>2.3 Choice of Statistical Topics To Be Investigated</h2>

<p>14 A list of 34 statistics topics was compiled, consisting of statistical tests and
procedures commonly found in introductory statistics texts and journal articles in the
behavioural sciences. This list was constructed partly from a list reported in a study of
the most common statistical procedures cited in the <i>American Educational Research Journal</i>
over a five-year period (<a href="#goodwin">Goodwin and Goodwin 1985</a>), and partly from the first author's own
experience over 16 years as a teacher of statistics to postgraduate education students. </p>

<p>15 In order to check on the curricular validity of these topics, the list was emailed
to subscribers to the EDSTAT-L network, an international group of people interested in
statistics education. The number of subscribers to this network is unknown to us, but is
presumably in the hundreds. Some are academic staff, some are students, while others are
high school teachers of statistics. The invitation to participate requested responses from
academic staff who had &quot;taught or co-ordinated a university statistics course in the
behavioural sciences or education&quot; (email message, 8 September 1997). Participants
were asked to rate the importance of each of the 34 topics in a statistics course aimed at
second- or third-year undergraduates taking courses in the behavioural sciences or
education. A five-point rating scale was used (<i>Essential, Very important, Important,
Relatively unimportant, Unnecessary</i>). Altogether, seven replies were received. In
addition, four local academics responded by fax or mail to a personal invitation to
participate. The topics, mean ratings and standard deviations are presented in Table 1, in
decreasing order of rated importance. An entry in the final column indicates that this
topic was tested. The letter codes refer to the items listed in <a href="appendix1.cfm">Appendix 1</a>; numbers in
parentheses, not used during the study for reasons explained later, have been added here
to facilitate location of the items in the Appendix. </p>

<p>16 Table 1 yields few surprises. Descriptive statistics and the more commonly used
inferential statistics received high ratings. Lower ratings were given to rarely used
statistics (semi-partial correlation, Sandler's A), to more complex, multivariate
parametric statistics (MANOVA, path analysis, cluster analysis, discriminant analysis),
and to nonparametric inferential statistics (Kruskal-Wallis, Friedman, Mann-Whitney,
Wilcoxon, sign-test, Fisher exact test). Several of these are still regarded as moderately
important (with mean ratings around 3). It is worth noting that the vast majority of the
entries (27 of the 34) received mean ratings above 3.00. </p>

<h2>2.4 Items for the Interview Phase</h2>

<p>17 The curricular validity phase of the project was carried out concurrently with the
writing of the stimulus items to be used in the interview study. The findings in Table 1
were used to guide the construction of the final set of items. A few items reflecting
topics rated as low in importance were discarded, and additional items were written on
topics rated as important. The salient word here is <i>guide</i>: although nonparametric
inferential statistics generally were rated as low in importance, two items (on
Mann-Whitney and sign-test) were retained in order to investigate students' understanding
of the relationship between levels of measurement and appropriate statistics. </p>



<p>18 Items consisted of an introductory paragraph describing a research situation
followed, in most cases, by some illustrative data. Figure 1 provides an example. The
complete list of 21 items is in <a href="appendix1.cfm">Appendix 1</a>. </p>

<h2>2.5 The Sample</h2>


<p>19    This was a small-scale study on a low budget, and
      it was therefore necessary to limit the sample to
      those students who could quickly be enlisted as
      volunteers through personal contacts with academic
      staff.  (The students were genuine volunteers; our
      university's ethics procedures preclude the use of
      any form of coercion to bring about participation in
      a research study.)  Although the sample was small and
      obviously not random, we attempted to include in it a
      representative set of university students at various
      levels of education.  The sample consisted of 23
      students (17 female, 6 male) at two universities in
      Melbourne, obtained with the cooperation of academic
      staff involved in teaching statistics to students of
      psychology or education.  Most students had completed
      six semesters of statistics as part of their degree
      program.  Some students were in their early twenties,
      while others were mature-age students.  Twelve
      students were enrolled in their final (third) year of
      undergraduate study; seven were pursuing a
      fourth-year graduate diploma program; three were
      taking a master's course (two through course-work,
      one by research thesis) and the remaining student was
      enrolled in a Ph.D. degree.  As the data to be
      presented later indicate, the 23 students varied
      widely in their levels of statistical knowledge.


<h2>2.6 The Interview</h2>


<p>20    Interviews were conducted with students
      individually.  Each session lasted for approximately
      one hour, divided into about five minutes of
      introduction, 45 minutes of interview as the student
      worked through the items and ten minutes of follow-up
      and debriefing.  In the first few minutes, the
      purpose of the research was explained; the student
      signed a consent form, and the interviewer outlined
      the nature of the questions that would be asked.

<p>21    Students were then presented with the items, one
      at a time. They were asked to state which statistical
      procedure they would be most likely to use to answer
      the research question. They were invited to "think
      out loud" and explain the reason for their answer. 
      The interviewer also asked several probing questions:

<ul>
       <li>  How did you decide?  Which information in the item alerted you to that choice?  What will the test tell you?
<p>

       <li>  Was it difficult to decide?  Which information in the item made it difficult?
<p>

       <li>  Did alternative possibilities come to mind?  Why were they rejected?
<p>

       <li>  How confident are you about the decision you made?  Was anything about the item ambiguous?  How confident are you out of 100?
</ul>

      Sometimes the interviewer would follow up a student's
      comment by asking further questions.

<p>22    Each item had been printed on a separate sheet of
      paper, inserted in a plastic cover and mounted in a
      ring binder, in the order shown in <a href="appendix1.cfm">Appendix 1</a>.  As
      each item was presented, the interviewer's questions
      and the student's answers were tape-recorded.  The
      interviewer wrote the item code letters and the
      student's selected statistical test and confidence
      rating for each item on a response sheet.

<p>23    As anticipated from an earlier pilot run, 45
      minutes was insufficient to allow each student to
      answer all 21 items in the set.  Full coverage of all
      items would have required about two hours, and this
      was considered to be an excessive demand upon the
      time of volunteers.  To ensure therefore that all
      items would receive approximately the same number of
      responses, successive interviews began at different
      points in the set, e.g., with S1 (Student 1), the
      interview began with the first item, S2 with the
      sixth item, S3 with the eleventh item, and so on. 
      The deliberate use of separate pages and code letters
      rather than item numbers meant that students were
      unaware that they were beginning in the middle of a
      sequence of items.  (The numbers next to each item
      code in <a href="appendix1.cfm">Appendix 1</a> have been inserted here so that
      readers may locate them easily; they did not appear
      in the material shown to students.)  In the final few
      minutes of the hour session, students were given a
      version of the list of 34 statistics topics used in
      the earlier curricular validity phase of the study,
      and asked to rate how familiar they were with each of
      the listed topics.  A five-point rating scale was
      used:

<ul>
       <li>  5:  It's very familiar and I would have no difficulty deciding when to use it.
<p>

       <li>  4:  It's pretty familiar, but I would not be absolutely certain about when to apply it.
<p>       

       <li>  3:  I recognise it, but I would not know when to apply it.
<p>

       <li>  2:  It rings the vaguest bell, but I certainly would not know when to apply it.
<p>

       <li>  1:  I have never even heard of it.
</ul>

<p>24    No material other than the items was presented to
      the students during the interview.  Students did not
      have access to lists of names of statistical
      procedures until they answered the familiarity
      question.  One student, however, had brought along a
      statistics text and consulted it at one stage of the
      interview.</p>


<h1>3. Quantitative Findings</h1>

<p>25    There were substantial variations within the
      sample in the numbers of items that students read
      within 45 minutes, in the proportion of those items
      that were answered correctly, and in their ratings of
      their confidence.


<h2>3.1 Number of Items Read and Answered</h2>

<p>26    Students varied widely in the number of items read
      in 45 minutes (mean 10.9, s.d. 3.2, range from 6 to
      17).  In some instances, students read an item,
      indicated that they did not know, and moved on to the
      next item without offering an answer.  The mean
      number of items for which students offered an answer
      was 8.6 (s.d. 3.4), with a range from 3 to 17. The
      cyclical presentation of the items ensured that all
      items received responses from about the same number
      of students (12 for nearly all items, with one item
      receiving 11 responses and the remaining item 13).


<h2>3.2 Responses to Items</h2>

<p>27    Students' responses to the various items were
      assessed as <i>fully correct</i> (an appropriate
      statistic was identified, named, and justified),
      <i>partly correct</i> (some conceptual understanding
      was displayed, together with some errors or
      omissions), <i>incorrect</i>, or <i>don't know</i>. 
      Of all the items read by all students, 25.3% were
      answered fully correctly, 15.7% partly correctly,
      37.8% incorrectly, while the remaining 21.3% were
      left unanswered.  Ratings of familiarity with the
      various statistical topics encompassed the full range
      from 1 to 5, with a modal response of 4 ("pretty
      familiar but not absolutely certain").


<h2>3.3 Items Answered</h2>

<p>28    Most students offered answers to between 8 and 12
      items (out of the 21) in the session, but there were
      four outliers: S15 (15 items) and S1, S2, and S8 (17
      each).  The large number of answers offered by these
      four fast-working students did not serve as an
      indicator of the knowledge they possessed:  there was
      no relationship between number of attempts and
      performance.  On the one hand, S8, a master's
      course-work student who had worked as a research
      assistant in psychology, answered 8 items fully
      correctly, the best performance (in terms of total
      number correct) of the whole sample, and S15, an
      undergraduate, succeeded on 6.  On the other hand, S1
      and S2 (both undergraduates) correctly answered 2 and
      0, respectively, out of 17.


<h2>3.4 Fully Correct Answers</h2>

<p>29    Numbers of fully correct answers varied from zero
      (S2, S11, S16, S19) to 8 (S8, already mentioned),
      with only 1, 2, or 3 correct responses being
      typical.  Expressed as a proportion of items
      attempted, the proportion correct varied from zero to
      0.56 (S23, who attempted 11 items).  A stem-and-leaf
      plot of the proportions of correct responses is
      presented in Figure 2.  In round figures, the
      probability of any student correctly answering any
      item varied from zero up to a half, with a mean of a
      quarter; however, the distribution was positively
      skewed, and most students performed quite poorly. We
      recognise that the small sample size and the diverse
      background of the students make it difficult to
      generalise accurately to a wider population, but
      contend that the data are sufficiently clear for us
      to draw the following conclusions with some
      confidence.  The findings point to a serious
      discrepancy between the students' self-reports of
      their familiarity with the concepts and their actual
      ability to use them correctly.  The findings also
      confirm previous literature reports that this is
      indeed a difficult task for most students.</p>

<p>30    It will be recalled that the sample in this study
      was a heterogeneous one, with half the students being
      undergraduates and the remainder being fourth-year,
      master's, or doctoral students.  Do students in the
      various levels differ in their performance?  The
      question can be answered by disaggregating the data
      in Figure 2.  It will be seen (Figure 3) that in
      general, the fourth-year students were among the
      better performers, and the undergraduates among the
      poorer performers.  This finding is not surprising,
      since admission into fourth-year programs is highly
      selective, with prior performance in undergraduate
      courses a major selection criterion.  Of the five
      students displaying the best performance, four were
      fourth-years, and one was the master's student with
      experience as a research assistant.  The finding is
      consistent with <a href="#ware2">Ware and Chastain's
      (1991)</a> earlier report of a positive relationship
      between selection skill and grade point average.</p>

<p>31    The relatively poor performance of the other three
      postgraduate students may come as a surprise.  As the
      numbers of postgraduates in the sample is very small,
      not too much should be made of this.  Some individual
      biographical data may, however, illuminate the
      unexpected finding.  The Ph.D. student had not
      studied statistics for ten years; one of the master's
      students had severe emotional problems with
      statistics, and another was a master's course work
      student in education who had probably studied far
      less statistics in her undergraduate program than the
      undergraduate psychology students in the sample.


<h2>3.5 Confidence Ratings</h2>

<p>32    Students were asked to rate their confidence (on a
      0 to 100% scale) in answering any item.  Their mean
      confidence rating was found, across all items for
      which an answer was offered. (<i>Don't know</i>
      answers were excluded from this calculation, since it
      was obviously pointless to ask students how confident
      they were if they answered in this way.)  The mean
      rating can be taken as a general (trait) indicator of
      that student's level of confidence.  The ratings
      varied widely, from 94% (S18) down to 25% (S19).  A
      stem-and-leaf plot of the ratings is presented in
      Figure 4, while Figure 5 displays the same data,
      disaggregated by year level. Although the differences
      are not marked, the median confidence rating of the
      fourth-year students is higher than that of the
      undergraduates, as one might expect for a group that
      have been selected on the basis of successful
      academic achievement.</p>

<h2>3.6 Relationships Between Confidence and Performance</h2>

<p>33    What is the relationship between students' ratings
      of their confidence and their performance on the
      items?  This question, apparently simple, can
      actually be answered in several different ways,
      depending upon the precise way the question is asked
      and upon the corresponding choice of an appropriate
      statistical design.  One way to ask the question is,
      "Do students who generally display a higher level of
      confidence tend to answer a larger proportion of
      items correctly?"   This question can be answered by
      finding the correlation between students' mean
      confidence ratings and the proportion of items
      correct.  This is a <b>between-subjects</b> design.

<p>34    Perhaps one might expect this correlation to be
      strongly positive, although a study by <a href="#prohaska">Prohaska (1994)</a> would indicate
      that perhaps the relationship is not so simple after
      all. Prohaska categorised advanced psychology
      students on the basis of their cumulative grade point
      average into high-, medium-, and low-GPA groups.  He
      asked students to estimate their final course grade
      and their level of confidence (on an 11-point scale)
      in their estimation.  Over-estimation was far more
      common than under-estimation or correct estimation;
      lower-ability students tended to over-estimate far
      more frequently than higher-ability students do.  All
      three groups were, on average, rather confident about
      their estimates, with the high-GPA students being
      slightly but significantly (p &lt; .05) more confident
      than the low-GPA students.

<p>35    In the present study, a scatterplot (not included
      here) of students' mean confidence ratings (across
      all the items they attempted) plotted against the
      proportion of those attempts that were correct shows
      a positive, but weak, linear relationship between the
      two variables.  The correlation was only moderate (r
      = 0.36), which for a two-tailed test (df = 21) falls
      short of significance at the .05 level (critical
      value, 0.41).  Certainly, there were students like
      S18 who performed relatively well (proportion
      correct, 0.50) and were highly confident (mean
      rating, 94%), but even in this case, some of the
      confidence was misplaced, since he was incorrect on
      half the items.  At the lower end of the
      distribution, there were students like S2 who
      displayed a justifiable lack of confidence (no
      correct answers, 27% confidence).  However, the weak
      correlation is explained by the presence of students
      such as S11, who displayed totally misplaced
      confidence (none right, 69% confident) and others
      like S23 who was the best performer (proportion
      correct 0.56) but was only 53% confident about her
      answers.  The findings suggest that most of the
      students in the sample held mistaken beliefs about
      the extent of their own statistical knowledge.  The
      weak positive relationship between confidence and
      performance is in line with Prohaska's findings.

<p>36    However, the question about the
      confidence-performance relationship can be asked in a
      quite different way, as a question about
      individuals.  For any particular student, the
      question becomes, "Is there a tendency for students
      to express higher levels of confidence on items they
      get correct?"   This requires a
      <b>within-subjects</b> design, and was answered by
      finding the correlation, for each student separately,
      between their confidence rating of a particular item,
      and their performance on that item (scored 2 for
      completely correct, 1 for partly correct, 0 for
      incorrect). Two students' data had to be discarded,
      since they displayed no variance in their scores. 
      The correlations for the remaining 21 students are
      displayed in Figure 6.</p>

<hr>

<p>37    Apart from the problem of the limited range of
      possible scores for each item, this analysis also
      suffers from a truncation of range problem:  if a
      student read an item but passed over it because the
      answer was unknown, no confidence rating was
      obtained.  Further, the individual correlations were
      based on small numbers of responses (between 5 and 17
      items) and are obviously not highly reliable.  While
      we recognise all of these limitations, it is still
      possible to conclude that the correlations are
      generally weak, and that there is wide variation.  If
      we assume that confidence ratings are an indicator of
      meta-cognitive self-awareness ("I know what I know
      and I know what I don't know"), our findings would
      indicate that most of the students in the sample did
      not seem to possess such self-awareness.  Only a few
      students seemed to be good judges of their own
      knowledge.  Of the five students displaying
      individual correlations above 0.50, four were also
      well above the median in performance (S7, S18, S8,
      S9, proportions correct 0.50, 0.50, 0.47, 0.38,
      respectively).  This analysis helps to explain the
      moderate correlation of 0.36 obtained earlier with
      the mean confidence ratings:  for about a quarter of
      the sample (generally more able students), the
      confidence-performance correlation is moderately
      strong, but the correlation is attenuated by the weak
      relationship among the remainder of the sample.

<p>38    One final method of probing the relationship is to
      take each confidence/performance data pair, pool them
      into a single data set, and then find the
      correlation.  This answers the question, "Do students
      in the sample generally display higher confidence
      ratings on items they answer correctly?" Pooling the
      data in this way yielded 192 data pairs; the
      correlation was 0.23 (two-tailed test, p &lt; .01).  In
      line with the earlier findings, the correlation
      between confidence and performance, although
      significant here, is again quite weak.


<h2>3.7 Responses to the Various Items</h2>

<p>39    The responses to the 21 items, together with
      students' confidence ratings and their ratings of
      familiarity with the topic, are summarised in Table
      2, in order of increasing item difficulty (decreasing
      frequencies of correct responses).  It is interesting
      to note that there is a high correlation between the
      rank order of the entries in this table and the rank
      order of the importance ratings in Table 1 (Spearman
      r<sub>s</sub> = 0.71).  There was hardly any commonality of
      membership between the instructors who rated the
      importance of the topics and the instructors who
      taught the students in the sample.  A plausible
      interpretation of the high correlation is that
      university statistics instructors in Australia and
      the United States hold similar views about the
      importance of the topics, and place more emphasis in
      their courses (class time, homework exercises,
      assessment weightings) on the more important topics.</p>

<h1>4. Qualitative Findings</h1>

<h2>4.1 Common Patterns of Difficulty</h2>

<p>40    Qualitative findings in the form of summaries of
      responses to each item are presented in <a href="appendix2.cfm">Appendix 2</a>. 
      Several patterns of difficulty, some cognitive and
      some affective, can be identified in these findings:

<ul>
       <li>  Misinterpretation of the research question,
<p>
       <li>  Inability to name a known procedure,
<p>
       <li>  Difficulties in recognising the measurement level of the data,
<p>
       <li>  Responding inappropriately on the basis of familiar verbal cues,
<p>
       <li>  Difficulties in interpreting slightly unusual forms of data presentation, and
<p>
       <li>  Emotional factors which may inhibit learning.
</ul>

<h2>4.2 Misinterpreting the Research Question</h2>

<p>41    Several students misinterpreted the research
      question, so that the selected statistical method
      would actually answer a different question from that
      posed in the item.  A clear example is displayed by
      S13, who classified Item CF(6) (t-test for correlated
      samples) as an ANOVA problem.  She regarded the ten
      pairs of cats as ten independent samples. If ANOVA
      were to be applied to such data, the analysis would
      tell whether there were significant differences in
      weight gains among the various pairs of cats, but not
      whether there was a significant difference between
      the two diets.  On Item HT(5) (testing simple
      regression), S16 proposed using a t-test "because
      we're looking for an association between factors."

<p>42    Item DM(2) (Pearson r) presented columns of values
      on two different variables; S21 proposed finding the
      means and using an "independent t-test."   Several
      students answering Item GI(19) (testing multiple
      correlation) displayed an inability to identify the
      nature of the research question, confusing the search
      for an index describing the strength of a
      relationship with the search for differences, or with
      the wish to make predictions.


<h2>4.3 Knowing the Procedure Without Knowing Its Name</h2>

<p>43    Some students could identify the appropriate
      procedure but were unable to name it.  S13, for
      example, read Item AB(4) and quickly recognised that
      an appropriate test was an inferential statistic that
      dealt with ranked data.  She had access to the
      textbook used in her course, quickly turned to the
      chapter at the end on nonparametric statistics and
      pointed to the section on the Mann-Whitney U-test. 
      S17 responded to Item HT(5) (the simple regression
      item) and recognised that "something extending from a
      correlation" was required to "predict using a line
      (like best fit) based on a certain score," but was
      unable to name the procedure.

<p>44    For others, the inability to name an appropriate
      procedure was associated with an extremely low level
      of performance during the interview.  The clearest
      example is S9, who attempted 11 items without being
      able to name even one procedure correctly.  She
      stated that she could not put a name to the theory or
      the steps involved while answering the items. 
      However, she claimed that she could examine the
      process, what needed to be done, what needed to be
      compared, and then use her resources including
      lecture notes to find the appropriate information. 
      (This student also displayed emotional problems in
      learning statistics; see below.)  S14 correctly named
      two statistical procedures out of eleven, and
      mentioned that he had "a general problem remembering
      the names of tests, but not a comprehension
      problem."   He said that he could work out what was
      wanted, and "then look up various possibilities and
      use a process of elimination."   S4, who correctly
      answered only one of 12 items, explained that his
      difficulty in remembering the names of procedures
      arose as a result of the computer package used to
      analyse data not requiring him to possess such
      information.


<h2>4.4 Difficulties in Identifying the Appropriate Level of
      Measurement</h2>

<p>45    The ability to determine whether the data in a
      research problem are nominal (categorical), ordinal,
      or interval/ratio is clearly a crucial one in
      learning to apply statistics.  Some students
      displayed difficulty with this. Chi-squared tests,
      for example, can be used only on frequency counts of
      nominal data, while t-tests and ANOVA require data in
      the form of scores which at least approximate
      interval properties.

<p>46    In Item MA(1) (ANOVA), the data presented were
      achievement test scores, yet S18 called the data
      "categorical."   In Item SH(12) (chi-squared test of
      association), S14 displayed no awareness of the
      nature of the data and proposed using a t-test, while
      S2 admitted that she "didn't know how to handle the
      data."   Similarly, in Item TC(7) (Spearman r), S5
      made no mention of the nature of the data and was
      unable to elaborate her answer:  "correlation ... 
      don't know which kind ...  I only know one kind."  
      S1 displayed a similar difficulty.  For Item RA(11)
      (t-test), S19 proposed using chi-squared "to see if
      it is significantly different from the mean"; it is
      possible that this reflects a nomenclature problem,
      but nothing in her answer indicated awareness of the
      interval nature of the data.


<h2>4.5 "Triggering" of Incorrect Responses by Familiar Words or Forms of Data Presentation</h2>

<p>47    Occasionally, students would note key words and
      phrases, or observe a familiar form of data
      presentation, that would lead them to an incorrect
      response.  This phenomenon is mentioned in <a href="appendix2.cfm">Appendix 2</a>
      in connection with Item II(13) (Fisher z
      transformation) where students seized upon the words
      "significant difference" or "observed and expected
      values" to offer "t-test" or "chi-squared" as their
      answers.

<p>48    In Item SH(12) (chi-squared), S2 noted the word
      "association" and answered "correlation ...  that's
      how you measure association."   S1 looked at the
      table included with this item, commented that it
      caused him some doubt, but then treated it as an
      ANOVA problem.  Conversely, S12 looked at the table
      in Item MA (ANOVA) and said that it was a
      "chi-squared 2 &times; 2" problem.


<h2>4.6 Unusual Forms of Data Presentation</h2>

<p>49    Students occasionally found an item difficult
      because the physical layout of the sample data was
      apparently unfamiliar.  For example, S23 stated that
      in the one-way ANOVA item, the horizontal listing of
      the values within each treatment level, rather than
      the more conventional vertical listing within
      columns, made the item awkward to read and
      ambiguous.  Similarly, in the t-test for correlated
      samples item, the presentation of the matched pairs
      as columns rather than the usual rows may have
      contributed to the difficulty that some students had
      in identifying the appropriate statistical procedure.


<h2>4.7 Affective Factors in Applying Statistical Procedures</h2>

<p>50    The emotional aspects of learning statistics were
      noted in the introduction to this report.  During the
      interviews, several students made statements and
      displayed behaviour that indicated clearly that the
      task had emotional overtones for them.  S7 stated
      that he had little experience in using the statistics
      he had learned, and he felt that his own confidence
      was low.  S5 similarly commented on her lack of
      confidence; during one item, she stated that she was
      "frustrated with herself" because she couldn't recall
      the procedure, while in answers to other items she
      referred to her "phobia" for statistics; she also
      referred to her frustration at the contradiction
      between her getting top marks for statistics
      assignments and her inability to answer questions
      during the interview easily and quickly.  S9 also
      lacked confidence in the interview, and started off
      feeling confused by the "mass of words and figures,"
      although she claimed that at home, with resources
      available, she would be able to answer the
      questions.  While attempting the one-way ANOVA item,
      she said that her ability to absorb information and
      think critically was obstructed by anxiety.  S4, who
      had reported his difficulty in remembering the names
      of statistical procedures, mentioned during
      debriefing that he had felt "stupid" during the
      interview.

<p>51    S19 reported having suffered serious emotional
      abuse over her statistical ability by a supervisor,
      who had called her an "idiot" and doubted her
      capacity for post-graduate work. She stated that she
      felt panic and paralysis of thought and could not
      respond to the items with any confidence.  She
      attempted eleven items and was unable to offer fully
      correct answers to any of them.  She could recall the
      name of only one statistical test, chi-squared, and
      tended to offer this repeatedly as an answer.



<h1>5. Implications for Teaching</h1>


<p>52    The findings of the present study confirm the
      extreme difficulty of the task.  The items were
      adapted from material used as illustrative examples
      or homework exercises in typical university
      statistics texts (or written in a style resembling
      such material).  The students had completed courses
      in which most of the procedures had been taught, and
      students generally claimed that they were quite
      familiar with these procedures.  Yet the probability
      that any student could correctly identify an
      appropriate procedure for any item is about 0.25. 
      Clearly, if an important goal of statistics education
      is the development of the ability to use,
      independently, the statistics one learns at
      university, then there is enormous scope for
      improvement.  Perhaps, in introductory courses, more
      time could be spent on giving students opportunities
      to practise this skill; such time might be found by
      reducing the number of topics taught.

<p>53    How to improve the teaching and learning of this
      skill is a question worthy of extensive further
      research.  Although not specifically concerned with
      this skill, <a href="#snee">Snee (1993)</a> expresses
      a more general concern of many statistics educators
      that all is not well with the teaching of statistics
      at university level.  Greater use should be made of
      knowledge from the behavioural sciences in order to
      enhance learning; statistics educators "need to
      deepen our understanding of how people learn" (p.
      150).  This, Snee argues, is not merely a matter of
      cognition.  Learning has an affective component: 
      people will study something only if they see value in
      it.  <a href="#shaughnessy">Shaughnessy (1992)</a>
      similarly calls for more "cooperative research
      efforts between psychologists and
      mathematics/statistics educators" (p. 490).

<p>54    The present study has focussed solely on the
      assessment of students' abilities and therefore sheds
      no direct light on how the ability to apply
      statistics might be enhanced. However, a few
      suggestions drawn from the research literature and
      from statistics texts may prove fruitful in the
      meantime:

<ul> <li>  Employ a "concept map" ("decision tree") to
       provide an overview of all the decisions that must
       be made in choosing an appropriate test.  <a href="#schau">Schau and Mattern (1997)</a> advocate
       the use of concept mapping to help students
       visualise the relationships between statistical
       ideas. Texts by <a href="#andrews">Andrews, Klem,
       Davison, O'Malley, and Rodgers (1981)</a> and <a href="#diekhoff">Diekhoff (1996)</a> contain
       material of this kind.  Diekhoff presents this
       material as the final chapter of his statistics
       text, intended no doubt as an effective summary of
       the central concepts of the book (which it certainly
       is).  However, the chapter could possibly also be
       valuable as an advance organiser right from the
       <i>beginning</i> of a course.
<p>
       <li>  Place more emphasis on learning to identify
	  the number of variables involved in a research
	  situation, and the nature of the research
	  question.  This advice parallels that of <a href="#quilici">Quilici and Mayer (1996)</a>; <a href="#diekhoff">Diekhoff (1996)</a> makes these
	  attributes central to his decision-tree approach.
<p>
       <li>  Give more practice at identifying the types of
	  variable (i.e., the level of measurement) in a
	  research situation.  <a href="#anderson_cw">Anderson and Loynes (1987)</a>,
	  in their book on the teaching of statistics,
	  emphasise the importance of students being "aware
	  of the various kinds of measurement -- to
	  distinguish counts from continuous variables and
	  so on -- since some techniques are inappropriate
	  for some kinds of data" (p. 24).  <a href="#runyon">Runyon, Haber, Pittenger, and
	  Coleman (1996)</a>, whose statistics text the
	  first author uses in his own class, recognise the
	  importance of this advice by devoting a chapter
	  specifically to this topic (Ch. 15, "Statistical
	  inference with nominal data").  <a href="#quilici">Quilici and Mayer (1996)</a> also
	  emphasise that students need to learn "whether
	  the variables are quantitative or categorical"
	  (p. 158).
<p>
       <li>  Educate students to <i>avoid</i> making
	  decisions simply on the basis of key words and
	  familiar forms of data presentation.
<p>
       <li>  Emphasise the importance of knowing accepted
	  names (including synonyms) for statistical
	  procedures in order to be able to use textbook
	  indexes and computer package menus correctly and
	  efficiently.
<p>
       <li>  Use items of the kind employed in this study
	  as a basis for workshop exercises for training in
	  this skill. Textbooks generally fail to include
	  such exercises.  It is of course eminently
	  logical to place exercises on correlation in the
	  chapter on correlation and exercises on ANOVA in
	  the chapter on ANOVA.  However, such forms of
	  presentation offer little opportunity for
	  students to learn to choose an appropriate
	  procedure when research problems arise (as they
	  do in the real world) outside their textbook
	  settings.
<p>
       <li>  Encourage students to build up a personal
	  portfolio, drawn from published research,
	  textbook exercises, or their own creative
	  writing, of research scenarios, annotated with
	  comments reflecting understanding of the research
	  question being asked, the nature of the data, or
	  any special conditions requiring an
	  unconventional procedure.  <a href="#keeler">Keeler (1997)</a> offers detailed
	  advice on the use of portfolios; she notes that
	  these can provide evidence of students' capacity
	  to "engage in authentic or real-world tasks which
	  are worth doing" (p. 170).
<p>
       <li>  Invite students to participate in projects in
	  which they design the data-gathering instrument
	  and gather the data themselves; the instructor
	  then draws upon the dataset at various points in
	  the course to exemplify the use of various
	  statistical procedures (<a href="#thompson">Thompson 1994</a>).  <a href="#starkings">Starkings (1997)</a> also
	  favours the use of projects which may involve
	  either the analysis of a given dataset, or the
	  gathering of data to answer a given research
	  question; she argues that such projects require
	  students to make decisions about what statistics
	  to use.  <a href="#mcburney">McBurney (1995)</a>
	  advocates posing a series of research problems
	  throughout the course and giving students a week
	  or two to propose appropriate research designs. 
	  In a similar vein, <a href="#dunn">Dunn
	  (1996)</a> favourably evaluates a teaching
	  strategy in which pairs of students design an
	  experiment, collect and analyse the data, and
	  write it up; much emphasis is placed on process
	  writing in which ideas are continually outlined,
	  drafted, and revised.
<p>
       <li>  Employ interesting and genuine examples for
motivational purposes.  Although their article is not
centrally concerned with the ability to apply statistics,
<a href="#anderson_mb">Anderson, Brewer, and Davis
(1996)</a> argue for the use of genuine case studies drawn
from sport and social psychology to illustrate the use of
statistical methods.  They cite a study in which
chi-squared was used to demonstrate that racial
considerations influenced the playing positions of US
footballers and baseballers.  Arguing along similar lines,
<a href="#derry">Derry, Levin, and Schauble (1995)</a>
place value on authenticity by emphasising "cultural
relevance and social activity" (p. 53) in teaching
statistics, rather than "decontextualised lectures" and the
analysis of "contrived data" (p. 54).  <a href="#snee">Snee
(1993)</a> argues, similarly, that statistics educators
"must change the content and delivery of statistical
education to enable students to experience the use of
statistical thinking and methods in dealing with real-world
problems and issues" (p. 153). </ul>

<p>55    The first author is currently adopting a few of
      these approaches in his course, one of them for the
      first time (the use of the Diekhoff decision tree as
      an advance organiser into which to fit new procedures
      as they are encountered in the course).
