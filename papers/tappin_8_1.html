<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The paper reports on a two-year investigation into the
feasibility of allocating three weeks of an undergraduate
calculus-based probability course to statistics.  This
brief introduction to statistics would take the place of a
course, thus constituting the students' only exposure to
statistical science.  At first glance, the request seemed
quite reasonable. Statistical inference is based on
probability, and statistical inference could be presented
as an application of probability. Besides introducing some
statistical concepts, it was hoped to enhance understanding
of probability by highlighting this connection.  However,
it was not possible for the students to learn anything
meaningful about statistical science in three weeks.  In
addition, any enhancements to the learning of probability
were not significant enough to warrant the omission of
material from that course.</p>

<h1>1. The Challenge</h1>

<p>1 Consider the following challenge:  Can you include a
three-week introduction to statistical science in an
undergraduate calculus-based probability course?  An
external review board had recommended that our computer
science curriculum include statistics, yet the course
requirements of the program did not allow time for a
statistics course. The mathematics requirements for the
computer science program were calculus I and II, followed
by probability and linear algebra, with calculus II the
prerequisite for the probability course. Since probability
was required for our statistical methods course, it was not
possible to add the statistics course to the curriculum
without adding three credits to the load.  One solution
under consideration was to add some statistical content to
the probability course.  Over a period of four semesters, I
had the opportunity to evaluate the feasibility of this
request, and if feasible, to recommend how the
probability course could be modified.</p>

<p>2 At first glance, the request seemed quite reasonable.
After all, statistical inference is based on probability. 
Topics in statistical inference could be included as
applications of the probability theory, thus enhancing
appreciation of the probability topics.</p>

<p>3 This task was not simple, but the exercise of
considering the possibility has been extremely valuable and
can be enlightening for all teachers of statistics and
probability. Some questions to address are "Where does
probability end and statistics begin?," "How does thinking
differ in probability and statistics?," "What aspects of
statistics should be covered?," "How should the material be
presented?," and "Is it reasonable to expect to present any
meaningful introduction to statistics in three weeks?"</p>

<p>4 Adding three weeks of statistics to  
the probability course necessitated omitting other
material.  I omitted the unit on bivariate distributions,
the final unit of the course.  This omission could be
justified if the time spent highlighting the differences
between statistics and probability served to enhance
understanding of the probability.</p>

<h1>2. Probability vs. Statistics</h1>

<p>5 Probabilistic models relate to phenomena with random or
chance outcomes.  In introductory probability, we study the
properties of certain of these models.  Here we assume that
the model is completely specified, in the sense that all
parameter values are known explicitly. In statistics, on
the other hand, while we consider a certain underlying
model, we do not assume that all parameter values are known,
and we use data to estimate or test hypotheses about
them.  Traditionally, we study the underlying probabilistic
models and their characteristics before learning how to use
data to make inferences about them.</p>

<p>6 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#scheaffer">Scheaffer (1995)</a>
distinguishes the reasoning involved in traditional
probability from the reasoning involved in applications of
probability to statistical science by describing the
following two "uses" of probability theory: "Both involve
an underlying probabilistic model, but the first
hypothesizes a model and then uses this model for practical
purposes, whereas the second deals with the more basic
question of whether the hypothesized model is in fact a
correct one ... Based on the sample data, inferences can be
drawn about the nature of the underlying probabilistic
mechanism -- a type of application known as <i>Statistical
inference</i>" (pp. 3, 4).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#cobb">Cobb
and Moore (1997)</a> note that "probability provides the
chance models that describe the variability in observed
data" (p. 820).</p>

<p>7 Our probability course is a typical course at the
undergraduate level, beginning with counting rules and the
axiomatic definition of probability and covering the common
discrete and continuous probability distributions and
expectation. The final units usually include bivariate
probability distributions and the central limit theorem. 
Simulation is used whenever feasible to illustrate the
random nature of the phenomena being modeled and the
variability inherent in these models.</p>

<p>8 Undergraduate students taking a probability course 
think in much the same way they have in all of the
mathematics courses prior to probability: they use
deductive reasoning. They prove theorems, make
calculations, and draw conclusions based on a given
underlying probability distribution.</p>

<p>9 In statistical inference, on the other hand, students
use inductive reasoning, generalizing from the observed
information in the sample to uncertain conclusions
regarding the population or process. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#moore">Moore (1992)</a> states that "the
subject matter of statistics is reasoning from uncertain
empirical data" (p. 15).  Statistics is usually the first
mathematics course where students are required to use
inductive reasoning extensively, and they find this to be a
very difficult transition. Students like to plug numbers 
into formulas, and they like certainty in their answers.
Interestingly, at the beginning of an introductory
statistics course, the students with more mathematical
training and experience with deductive reasoning have a
more difficult time with this transition than students with
a more limited background in mathematics.</p>

<p>10 This simplified view is not meant to suggest that
students learn probability in exactly the same way that
they learned calculus.  Discussions of the importance of
learning to think probabilistically and the difficulties in
teaching students to do so can be found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#falk">Falk and Konold (1992)</a>,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#konold">Konold (1995)</a> and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#pfannkuch">Pfannkuch and Brown
(1996)</a>.  I emphasize inductive vs. deductive
reasoning to highlight the difficult transition from
thinking probabilistically to thinking statistically, a
transition that usually takes two to three weeks at the
beginning of an introductory statistics course.  The
challenge here is that we had only three weeks
available for the entire statistics unit.</p>

<h1>3. First Attempts</h1>

<p>11 Our external review board did not specify what it
meant by "statistics," and perhaps it would have been
satisfied with evidence that the students had learned how
to calculate sample means and variances.  However, this
approach would in no way reflect the spirit of statistical
science, nor would it enhance understanding of the
probability being studied.</p>

<p>12 The current trend in statistics education is to first
cover exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data production,
and then follow with the more formal statistical
inference.  See the discussion in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#cobb">Cobb and Moore (1997)</a>.  EDA
would lend itself well as a brief introduction to
statistical science.  There is no underlying theory
necessary, much of the work is graphical, and students can
very quickly begin making discoveries with their data.  We
did not take this approach because of the time required to
resolve data management and technology issues.  It was also
felt that the statistical content should include some
calculation of probabilities, to allow a smooth transition
between the two subjects. The most logical approach seemed
to be to present statistical inference as an application of
the probability models already in the course. It is in this
area where the link between probability and statistical
science is the strongest.</p>

<p>13 My first attempt at revising the course was to
introduce the sampling distribution of the mean and
significance testing for a single mean as the introduction
to statistics.  Because the normal distribution was the
last distribution studied, this unit appeared at the end of
the course.  The topics were presented as applications of
the normal distribution, with <i>p</i>-values calculated as
normal probabilities. The mean and variance of the sampling
distribution were derived using the properties of
expectation and independence.  The simplest approach was to
work with small samples assumed to come from a normal
distribution with known variance. Although we studied the
central limit theorem, working with large samples added
complications to the statistics unit.  The data handling
effort was greater, and time had to be spent discussing
when a sample is "large enough" to assume normality.  I
also did not want to have to estimate the standard
deviation from the data.  With such a limited time frame, I
wanted to focus attention on the ideas of inference, and
not on the properties of sampling distributions other than
the normal distribution. Simulation was done to illustrate
these ideas, and significance testing was restricted to
one-sided tests of the mean.</p>

<p>14 This approach yielded disappointing results.  Most
students could calculate a <i>p</i>-value but could not
interpret it.  In a typical assignment, students might be
given a small dataset and asked to calculate the
<i>p</i>-value and use it to reach a conclusion as to
whether or not the data suggested that the population mean
was significantly larger than some value.  Although most
students could calculate <i>p</i>, they did not know how to
use it to reach a conclusion.  Even the better students
admitted that they would guess the answer, or they reasoned
that if the sample mean were larger, then the parameter
must be significantly larger than the hypothesized value.
They had no notion of how this question related to the
sampling distribution of the mean or to the
<i>p</i>-value.</p>

<p>15 The students were discouraged and frustrated, as they
realized that I was not satisfied with the results.  I
thought the difficulty might be due to the abstract nature
of significance testing, so I repeated this approach during
a subsequent semester using confidence intervals.  The idea
of obtaining a "ballpark" estimate of the population mean
is a lot easier to motivate.  This is more intuitive than
asking students to assess whether or not the evidence in a
sample is sufficient to reject a certain null hypothesis
regarding a population mean.  Students were able to
calculate a confidence interval, but they really did not
understand what it represented.  They could memorize the
statement, "I am 95% confident that the population mean
lies between a and b."  Or they could state that "c" is a
viable estimate for the population mean because a &lt; c &lt; b. 
Morale was better when working with confidence intervals,
and there were more correct responses on exams, but it did
not seem that the students had any deeper understanding of
confidence intervals than of <i>p</i>-values.  Few students
seemed to understand the difference between the sample and
the population, or that their intervals represented
estimates of a population mean.</p>

<p>16 These difficulties are no different from those
frequently encountered by students in a general statistics
course when they are first introduced to the abstraction of
statistical inference.   In a full course, however, there
is time to develop the ideas more fully, and to work with
many datasets having a context.   Suppose that, instead of
just working textbook inference problems, the students are
given the problem of estimating the mean grade point
average (GPA) of all students at Montclair State University
(MSU).  If they obtain the GPA's of a sample of 30
students, they certainly understand the difference between
the mean GPA of the 30 students and the mean GPA of the
entire student body.  They may not fully understand the
theory, but they can understand that the methods of
statistical inference allow them to use the information in
their samples to make statements about the population
mean.</p>

<p>17 The exercises used in the first two offerings of the
course  attempted to link statistics to probability but did
not expose students to the practice of statistics.  The
<i>p</i>-value or confidence interval may be useful at a
certain stage of solving a statistical problem, but their
calculation is not the focal point of the problem-solving
process.  Without understanding the motivation of the
original problem, having knowledge of the data collection
process, and being involved in assessing the quality and
characteristics of the data, calculating a <i>p</i>-value
or confidence interval is simply an exercise in
arithmetic.  These results have no context.  As  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#moore">Moore (1992)</a> points out,
"Statistics is the science of data ... they [data] are
numbers with a context" (p. 15).</p>  

<p>18 At this point I realized that whatever else was
included in the course, the students should experience
statistical thinking.</p>

<p>19 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#kinney">Kinney's (1997)</a>
recent textbook,  <cite>Probability: An Introduction With
Statistical Applications</cite>, proceeds in much the same
way as described above, exposing students to sampling
distributions, significance testing, and confidence
intervals with a mathematical, rather than a statistical,
treatment.  If Kinney's course is followed with a course in
statistics then the exposure to some of these concepts may
be useful.  But this type of treatment should not be
confused with statistical thinking, and students and
instructors alike should realize that statistical practice
does not resemble this kind of theoretical treatment.</p>

<p>20 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#snee">Snee (1993)</a> states
that "the 'content side' of statistics education should
move away from the mathematical and probabilistic approach
and place greater emphasis on data collection,
understanding and modeling variation, graphical display of
data, design of experiments, surveys, problem solving, and
process improvement."  He adds, "The goal should be to
integrate the statistical thinking into the subject matter
on which the student is working.  Personal interest in the
subject matter to which the statistical methodology is
being applied and personal participation in the data
collection and problem-solving processes are essential for
developing value for statistical thinking" (p. 151).</p>

<h1>4. Improvements</h1>

<p>21 In later offerings of the course, two major changes
were made to the original approach:  the students collected
their own data, and the data were binary.  In statistical
practice the normal distribution is prevalent, but the
derivation of the sampling distribution of the mean
requires considerable time.  In analyzing binary data, we
used the total number of successes, rather than the
proportion of successes, as the test statistic.  This
allowed the students to work with exactly the same random
variable they had been studying in the probability course,
thus eliminating the need to derive a sampling
distribution.</p>

<p>22 The need for experiential learning in statistics is
well-documented, and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#snee">Snee
(1993)</a> states, "Collection and analysis of data is at
the heart of statistical thinking. Data collection promotes
learning by experience and connects the learning process to
reality" (p. 152).  The exercises described below are
simple, yet they illustrate many of the important issues of
proper survey and experimental methodology.  Students are
required to think about random sampling, wording of survey
questions, and nonresponse in surveys, as well as
randomization and consistent measurement in conducting
experiments. Because the students collect the data
themselves, the data have a context.  Because no time must
be spent deriving the sampling distribution, attention can
be focused on statistical thinking and interpretation
of the data.</p>

<p>23 Note that "significance testing" is done in only the
most informal way. Assuming a certain value of <i>p</i>,
the binomial probability of success, the graphing
calculator is used to display a histogram of the
distribution of <i>X</i>, the total number of successes. 
The appearance of the histogram is used to initially classify values
as "likely" or "unlikely."  The tail probability is then
calculated and judgment is based upon this value.  No
distinction is made between one- and two-sided significance
tests.</p>


<h1>5. Specific Exercises</h1>

<p>24 The following four exercises can be used to introduce ideas of statistical thinking.  The exercises
are very simple, but the issues addressed and the
discussions generated are extremely rich in content.</p>

<p>25 In the first exercise, students perform an experiment
where the parameter value is known.  For example, each
student is asked to flip a coin six times and record the
total number of heads observed. They are asked, "Do your
results seem consistent with the hypothesis that <i>p</i> =
.5, i.e., that the coin is fair?" Ten students then combine
their results and are asked the same question. They
continue by comparing the combined result with each
individual result. This is a very important exercise where
students can see that even though the coin was fair, the
data from a single sample may have suggested otherwise. 
They also see the increased accuracy in using a larger
sample.  Discussions also follow regarding the possibility
that different students showed different results due to
variations in flipping technique.</p>

<p>26 The second exercise has students predict the value of
an unknown parameter, and then conduct an experiment to see
if the data support their hypothesis.  Each student is
asked to begin by estimating the probability that a
thumbtack will land point up when tossed.  Each student
then flips a thumbtack six times and records the total
number of "ups."  They address the same issues mentioned
above in the coin tossing experiment, but here they are
made uncomfortable by the fact that the true probability is
unknown. They begin to see that the statements we make from
our data can never be made with certainty.</p>

<p>27 The third exercise involves a survey where responses
are binary -- for example, "Do you believe that abortion
should be legal?" First, each student predicts the
proportion of MSU students who favor legalized abortion. 
They survey ten "randomly selected" MSU students, use the
data to test their hypothesis, and, as above, combine their
results with those of other students.  Here additional
discussion topics include "Whom did you include in your
sample?," "What is a random sample?," "How did you approach
each respondent?," "Did each respondent understand the
question?," "Did some people refuse to respond?," "Did you
falsify any of your data?"  Most of these questions are
generated by the students themselves as they attempt to
produce accurate data. They realize firsthand how the
conclusions they can draw from their data are limited by
the reliability of their collection methods.</p>

<p>28 In the fourth exercise, each student formulates a
survey question or plans an experiment with a binary
response.  They must consider all of the issues brought out
in the previous exercise, as well as select a sample size
that they think will be adequate to accurately estimate
the unknown parameter. The sample size question generates
interesting discussion, as students have realized by now
that a larger sample size will produce a more accurate
estimate.  However, faced with the prospect of actually
performing the survey or experiment, they realize that
sample sizes must be limited, and that there is a tradeoff
between economy and precision.</p>

<p>29 I present the first two exercises at the beginning of
any probability course.  They make an excellent
introduction to the definition of a probability.  For the
current investigation, I revisited all four exercises at
the end of the unit on the binomial random variable, the
first discrete random variable studied.  We then added
calculator simulations of binomial random variables with a
variety of parameter values.  Presenting this connection
between real-world and theoretical probability models
relatively early in the course allows the instructor to
refer to this relationship as other probability models
are studied.</p>

<p>30 This approach was used during two semesters, and the
results were excellent. The students were excited by their
work and showed evidence of truly understanding the
concepts.  Their questions and concerns regarding data
acquisition and interpretation demonstrated an awareness of
many of the issues involved in the practice of statistical
science.</p>

<p>31 The exercise of having the students generate their own
survey questions was particularly revealing.  Many who had
performed very well on standard binomial problems were not
able to generate their own binary survey questions without
some assistance from the instructor.  This came as quite a
surprise.  I had expected this fourth exercise to be
straightforward for students at the end of a unit on the
binomial random variable.  Some did not know how to begin,
some suggested open-ended questions, and others gave
questions whose responses would not be binary.  Upon
completion of this exercise, however, I did feel that the
students had a deeper understanding of the binomial random
variable and of the notion that the other probability
models we would study also have practical applications.</p>

<h1>6. Conclusions</h1>

<p>32 Have we achieved our goal?  Yes and no.</p>

<p>33 Yes, the above approach using binary variables does
successfully introduce the essence of statistical science
in three weeks, and preserves a connection to the material
in the probability course. The students collect their own
data and are asked to use these data to make inferences. 
They discuss proper sampling and the significance of sample
size.  They have a better understanding of the binomial
random variable from having to formulate their own binary
survey questions.  They also apply this experience to the
other probability distributions they study and realize that
those distributions represent different models for random
behavior.</p>

<p>34 Although the basics of statistical inference are
presented, this treatment is much too brief and far too
limited in scope to convey the power and subtlety of
statistical science. Students never work with data from a
continuous distribution, nor do they experience exploratory
data analysis.  They do not see linear regression, or
consider the issues involved in more formal significance
testing or parameter estimation. They have no exposure to
the testing of assumptions for a variety of methods.</p>

<p>35 Although some of the proposed exercises may be useful
to enhance understanding of the probability topics, an
effort to specifically introduce statistical ideas into the
probability course is not recommended.  Probability is
important in its own right, not only as preparation for
statistics.  Our mathematics majors benefit greatly from
this required course.   Besides honing their
problem-solving skills and applying the calculus, they
receive preparation for work in such areas as mathematical
modeling.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#cobb">Cobb and Moore
(1997)</a> note, "the domain of determinism in natural and
social phenomena is limited, so that the mathematical
description of random behavior must play a large role in
describing the world" (p. 820).  They are "hesitant to move
any strictly statistical ideas into the probability
semester" (p. 822).</p>

<h1>7. Recommendations</h1>

<p>36 My recommendation (which has been adopted) was to
remove the probability prerequisite from the statistical
methods course and leave the traditional probability course
unchanged.  Thus, students could take either probability,
statistical methods, or both.  The statistics course would
change slightly, with more emphasis on data and less on
theory. For students taking both courses, I would recommend
they take statistical methods before probability.  I
believe that the theory will make more sense to students
after they have been exposed to the practice of
statistics.</p>

<p>37 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064037/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tappin.cfm#cobb">Cobb and Moore (1997)</a>
also believe that "first courses in statistics should
contain essentially no formal probability theory" (p.
820).  They reason that "informal probability is sufficient
for a conceptual grasp of inference."   They feel that "we
faculty imagine that formal probability illumines" the
essential ideas of statistics and that this is "simply not
true for almost all of our students" (p. 821).</p>

<p>38 When I began this project, I thought of probability
and statistics as inexorably linked. I had not given much
thought to where one ended and the other began.  Now I
realize their distinctness -- each taught and learned in
very different ways, yet still connected.  These
differences and dependencies should be carefully considered
when developing either of these courses or the programs
that depend on them.</p>
