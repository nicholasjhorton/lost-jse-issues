<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Real world examples of the reversal of the direction of
an association when an additional explanatory variable is
taken into account are unusual and hard to find.  This
article presents an example of Simpson's paradox from a
South African longitudinal study of growth of children. 
The example demonstrates the importance race plays in every
aspect of South African life.</p>

<p>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>Simpson's Paradox <a href="#simpson">(Simpson 1951)</a>
occurs when the direction of an association between two variables is reversed
when a third variable is controlled.  This topic is sometimes covered in
introductory statistics courses.  For example, the
introductory texts by <a href="#moore">Moore and McCabe
(1998)</a> and <a href="#wardrop">Wardrop (1995)</a>
include a section on this paradox.  In addition, two recent
papers provide examples of this reversal (<a href="#appleton">Appleton, French, and Vanderpump 1996</a>
and <a href="#westbrooke">Westbrooke 1998</a>).  However,
real world examples of the paradox are rare.  This paper
presents an example of Simpson's Paradox that occurred in a
South African longitudinal study of growth of children.</p>


<h1>2. The Birth to Ten Study</h1>


<p>The Birth to Ten study (BTT) (<a href="#yach">Yach et
al. 1991</a>, <a href="#levitt">Levitt et al. 1999</a>)
commenced in the greater Johannesburg/Soweto metropolitan
area of South Africa during 1990.  A birth cohort was
formed from all singleton births during a seven-week period
between April and June 1990 to women with permanent
addresses within a defined area.  Identification of
children born during this seven-week period and living in
the defined areas took place throughout the first year of
the study, by the end of which 4029 births had been
enrolled. The BTT study collected prenatal, birth, and
early development information on these children.  The aim
of the study was to identify factors related to the
emergence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in
children living in an urban environment in South Africa. 
In 1995, when the children were five years old, the
children and caregivers were invited to attend interviews. 
Detailed questionnaires were completed that included
questions about living conditions within the child's home,
the child's exposure to tobacco smoke, and additional
health-related issues.  The five-year sample consisted
of 964 children.  Unfortunately, there was a great deal of
missing data in the baseline group, especially on the
variables reported below.</p>

<p>If the five-year sample is to be used to draw
conclusions about the entire birth cohort, the five-year
group should have characteristics similar to those who were
not traced from the initial group.  Thus, the five-year
group was compared to those who did not participate in the
five-year interview on a number of factors.  One of the
factors was a variable that determined whether the mother
had medical aid (which is similar to health insurance) at
the time of the birth of the child. </p>


<h1>3. The Paradox</h1>

<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> shows that 11.1% of those
in the five-year cohort had medical aid, whereas 16.6% of
those who were not traced had medical aid.  This difference
is statistically significant (<i>p</i>-value = .007).  The
subjects in the BTT study are also classified by their
racial group.  In this article, we consider only white and
black participants in the BTT study.  <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> shows the distribution of the
medical aid variable broken down by the race of the
participants.  For white participants, 83.3% of those in
the five-year follow-up cohort had medical aid, whereas
82.5% of  those who did not participate in the five-year
tests had medical aid.  In the black group, the
corresponding percentages are 8.9% and 8.7%.  This shows
that even though overall a smaller percentage of
participants had medical aid in the five-year cohort, when
the race of the subjects is taken into account, the
association is reversed.  However, there is no
statistically significant difference between the
percentages when race is taken into account (<i>p</i>-value
= .945 and .891 for whites and blacks, respectively).</p>

<h1>4. Discussion</h1>

<p>This reversal, or elimination, of association is easily
explained.  Whites tend to have much more access to medical
aid than do black South Africans.  In addition, many more
blacks were originally included in the Birth to Ten study
than whites.  Consequently, when the race groups are
combined, a relatively small percentage of the subjects
have access to medical aid.  At the five-year follow-up,
very few whites agreed to attend the screening exams (only
8.6% of those with data on the medical aid variable). 
Possibly the whites felt that they had little to gain from
participating in the study, while a larger proportion of
blacks (27.8% of those with data on the medical aid
variable) continued into the five-year study.  The blacks
may have valued the medical checkup and screening provided
to children in the study as a replacement for (or in
addition to) a regular medical checkup.</p>



<h1>5. Getting The Data</h1>

<p>The file <a href="/web/20130307064235/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/datasets/birthtotena.dat.txt">birthtotena.dat.txt</a>
contains the category labels and cell frequencies for the
three-way table (<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>). The file
<a href="/web/20130307064235/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/datasets/birthtotenb.dat.txt">birthtotenb.dat.txt</a>
lists each case on a separate line with three variables 
that indicate whether or not the mother had medical
aid, whether or not the mother was traced for the five-year
interview, and race. The file <a href="/web/20130307064235/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/datasets/birthtoten.txt">birthtoten.txt</a>
is a documentation file containing a brief description of
the datasets. </p>
