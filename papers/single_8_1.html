<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The use of tangible examples can make the concepts of
statistical sampling and survey design more meaningful for
college students. These concepts are especially relevant
with the advent of the 2000 Census and the debate over its
use of statistical sampling.</p>

<p>In this paper, basic ideas from survey design are
introduced using the 2000 Census as an example, in order to
capitalize on the recent media attention. Then, these same
concepts are applied to the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS).  Data for the 1993 NHIS can be accessed
through the National Center for Health Statistics web site
and simple analyses can be performed over the web to
demonstrate the use of sampling weights. In addition,
subsets of the data can be downloaded and analyzed using
statistical software packages.</p>

<p>The methods of statistical sampling and the structure of
a national survey have a variety of applications in the
classroom, depending on the level of the course being
taught. This paper discusses some of these applications and
how to access and use these data as an effective teaching
tool.</p>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<h2>1.1 Background</h2>

<p>1 In this paper, basic ideas from survey design are
introduced using the 2000 Census as an example, in order to
capitalize on the recent media attention. Then, these same
concepts are applied to the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS). The main objective of this paper is to
introduce basic information about a major national survey
that can be used as an example in the classroom. In
addition, two examples are presented that describe how data
from the NHIS can be accessed via the Internet. The NHIS,
in particular the 1993 survey, was chosen because of its
accessibility. It can be used by teachers and students to
explore concepts related to survey design, such as sampling
and stratification, and issues related to the development
and execution of surveys.</p>

<p>2 The 1993 National Health Interview Survey included
52,467 males and 57,204 females. Through the use of
statistical weights, these 109,671 individuals represent a
population of 254,281,227, which is an approximation of the
1993 noninstitutionalized U.S. population. The NHIS is one
of the oldest national health surveys conducted by the U.S.
Bureau of the Census for the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS). Recently, the Census Bureau has received
a great deal of attention in politics and the news for its
proposed statistical methods in the 2000 Census.</p>

<p>3 This paper discusses issues related to statistical
sampling and the use of statistical weights using the NHIS
and the 2000 Census. These issues have a variety of
illustrative uses in the classroom depending on the level
of the course being taught. Sampling and weighting can be
mentioned as enrichment topics in an introductory
statistics class, can be explored in further detail with
intermediate statistics students, and can be used in a
project, lab, or an independent study with upper level
students.</p>

<p>4 After a brief description of some of the controversy
over the 2000 Census in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#section1.2">Section 1.2</a>, the concepts

sampling design and weights are discussed in relation to
the NHIS. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#section3">Section 3</a>

In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#section4">Section 4</a>, aspects of
using the NHIS as a teaching tool are discussed.</p>

<a name="section1.2"><h2>1.2 Recent Controversy Over Sampling</h2></a>

<p>5 There has been much debate over the use of statistical
sampling for the 2000 Census. Statistical sampling has been
suggested as a way to correct the undercount and
differential coverage of U.S. residents. This undercount is
more severe for certain minority groups. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table1">Table 1</a> lists estimated
percent undercounts from the 1990 Census generated by the
Census Bureau from the Post Enumeration Survey.</p>

<p></p><hr><p></p>

<p>6 The debate focuses on the use of statistical weights
and the assumptions that need to be made in order to
incorporate statistical sampling in the census. Because
there are many uses for the information collected in the
census, these issues have become politicized. In August of
1998, a Federal Court panel determined that an actual head
count must be used to allocate congressional seats among
the states. The court panel ruled that the use of
statistical sampling for the apportionment of congressional
seats would be a violation of the Census Act. Arguments
against the use of statistical sampling for congressional
apportionment claim that manipulation of the sample
selection would occur by Republicans and Democrats alike.
As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#moore">Moore (1998)</a> states with
regard to the misrepresentation of the scientific method of
statistical sampling, there are fears that "a conspiracy
lurks behind every weighted mean."</p>

<p>7 In April of 1998, the American Statistical Association
(ASA) filed an amicus brief in the census court cases
responding to attacks on the methodology of statistical
sampling (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#asa">American Statistical Association
1998</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/gate/singlelink6.html">http://www.amstat.org/outreach/amicus.html</a>).
The brief stated that the ASA does not take a position on
the legality or constitutionality of statistical sampling
in the 2000 Census. It went on to state that the "ASA is,
however, concerned to defend statistically designed
sampling as a valid, important, and generally accepted
scientific method for gaining accurate knowledge about
widely dispersed human populations."</p>

<p>8 The NHIS and the 2000 Census provide excellent examples
to introduce students to statistical weights and sampling.
The concept of statistical weights will be introduced below
using one of the proposed adjustments for the 2000 Census
at a level that is approachable for college-level
statistics students.</p>

<a name="section1.3"><h2>1.3 Sampling and Weighting in the Census</h2></a>

<p>9 Although statistical sampling will not be used for
congressional apportionment, the Census Bureau will use
this technique to help increase the accuracy of the 2000
Census for other applications. The Census Bureau has issued
two plans for conducting the 2000 Census. The first,
"Census 2000 Operational Plan," uses statistical sampling
methodology throughout. The second, "Census 2000
Operational Plan: Using Traditional Census-Taking Methods,"
is a plan for conducting the census without statistical
sampling for the purpose of apportionment.</p>

<p>10 Under the first plan, a scientific sample survey of
approximately 300,000 housing units will be conducted after
the Census enumeration to generate corrected counts (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#census99">U.S. Census Bureau 1999</a>).
For the 2000 Census, this survey is called the Accuracy and
Coverage Evaluation (ACE). An estimate of the number of
people missed or incorrectly counted in the Census will be
made based on the results of the ACE. The "CensusPlus"
plan, one of the methods for correcting the counts
considered by the Census Bureau, is described below.
Although this is not the method chosen by the Census
Bureau, it is described in detail because it has an
intuitive appeal that makes it accessible to students.</p>

<p>11 Suppose that one wants to determine the number of
people, <i>N<sub>A</sub></i>, living in an eight block
region <i>A</i>. After an initial enumeration is made in
this region, a second independent enumeration is made in a
randomly chosen subset of region <i>A</i>, say a two-block
region <i>B</i>. Extra effort is put into this second
enumeration so that a higher proportion of the actual
residents are counted.</p>

<p>12 To describe the adjustment of the count in region
<i>A</i> based on the second enumeration of subregion
<i>B</i>, I will define the following terms:</p>

<blockquote><i>n<sub>ij</sub></i>: the number of people
found in region <i>i</i> by enumeration <i>j</i>, where
<i>i</i> = <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>j</i> = 1,
2</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>n<sub>B</sub></i><sub>(1<img src="./single_8_1_files/union.gif" height="10">&nbsp;2)</sub>: the number of people found in
region <i>B</i> by <i>either</i> the first or the second
enumeration</blockquote>

<p>Then, the corrected count for region <i>A</i>, using
the "CensusPlus" correction, is</p>


<p></p><center>
<img src="./single_8_1_files/count.gif" alt="\begin{displaymath}{\hat{N}}_A = n_{A1} \biggl( \frac{n_{B(1 \cup 2)}}{n_{B1}}\biggr).\end{displaymath}" height="45" width="162">
</center><p></p>

<p>13 It can be pointed out to the students that this is the
original count in region <i>A</i> multiplied by a scaling
factor that is always greater than or equal to one. The
scaling factor, <i>n<sub>B</sub></i><sub>(1<img src="./single_8_1_files/union.gif" height="10">&nbsp;2)</sub>/
<i>n<sub>B</sub></i><sub>1</sub>, is the statistical weight
for an individual in region <i>A</i>. Since the numerator
is the number of people found by either enumeration, it is
always greater than or equal to the denominator, which is
the number found in the first enumeration. The statistical
weight is larger when more people are identified by the
second enumeration that were not identified by the first.
Using the "CensusPlus" correction, each individual in
region <i>A</i> represents <i>n<sub>B</sub></i><sub>(1<img src="./single_8_1_files/union.gif" height="10">&nbsp;2)</sub>/<i>n<sub>B</sub></i><sub>1</sub> people.</p>

<p>14 The method chosen by the Census Bureau is called Dual
System Estimation. The count correction is similar to one
based on the capture-recapture method with an added
adjustment for the estimated number of erroneous
enumerations made in the Census (See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#mulry">Mulry
and Griffiths 1996</a> for details).</p>

<p>15 It is important for students to realize that statistical
sampling is used not only as a means of correcting
population counts, but can be used as an integral part of a
sampling design (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#ferber">Ferber, Sheatsley, Turner,
and Waksberg 1980</a>). For example, statistical sampling has been
used by the Census Bureau since 1940 to determine which
housing units are sent detailed questionnaires. Only 17% of
all housing units are slated to receive the "long form,"
which requests more detailed demographic information from
the respondents. The subset of the U.S. population that
receives the "long form" instead of the "short form" is
determined using a scientific sample to ensure the accuracy
and reliability of estimates made from these data.</p>

<p>16 The NHIS is an example of a survey that uses
statistical sampling to produce estimates that are
representative at a national level. Discussion of the
sampling design and the development of statistical weights
in the NHIS provides an interesting example that can be
used to highlight several topics in survey design and
probability.</p>

<a name="section2"><h1>2. The Structure of the NHIS</h1></a>

<h2>2.1 Background</h2>

<p>17 The National Health Interview Survey has been
conducted annually since 1957 by the U.S. Bureau of the
Census for the NCHS to provide information about the health
of the resident, civilian, noninstitutionalized population
living at the time of the interview. It is one of the
oldest national health surveys. The survey is not
administered to individuals living in nursing homes,
members of the armed forces, individuals that are
institutionalized, or United States citizens living
abroad.</p>

<p>18 The survey includes a core set of questions on
demographic and health-related variables, which remain
relatively constant, and a set of supplements that change
from year to year. The core survey is administered to every
individual in the sample. Each individual is then asked
questions from one of the supplements.</p>

<a name="section2.2"><h2>2.2 Sampling Design</h2></a>

<p>19 The sampling design of the NHIS is a multistage,
personal interview probability sample (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#massey">Massey, Moore,  Parsons, and Tadros
1989</a>). The sampling frame consists of geographical
areas defined in three stages. Every member of the target
population, the resident, civilian, noninstitutionalized
U.S. population, belongs to one area unit. This complex
design is used so that the resulting data are
representative of the target population, a high response
rate is maintained, and the cost of executing the survey is
not prohibitive.</p>

<p>20 In the first stage of the sampling design, the United
States is divided into approximately 1,900 geographic
regions called Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). A PSU
consists of a county, a group of adjacent counties, or a
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (see Figure 1).</p>


<a name="Figure1"><hr></a>
<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single01.gif">
<img src="./single_8_1_files/single01.icon.gif" height="112" width="74">Figure 1 (14.4K gif)</a>
<p>
Figure 1. Flowchart of the NHIS Sampling Design.</p>

<hr>


<p>21 The 52 largest PSUs are automatically selected into
the sample. These are called self-representing PSUs. The
remaining non-self-representing PSUs are then clustered
into 73 strata based on socioeconomic and demographic
variables. From each of the 73 strata, two PSUs are
selected into the sample with probability proportional to
the size of their population. These 146
non-self-representing and 52 self-representing PSUs give a
total of 198 PSUs selected in the first stage.</p>

<p>22 In the second stage of the sampling design, the PSUs
are divided into smaller geographic units called segments.
Each segment consists of several households. Roughly 7,500
segments are sampled from the total number that are
identified. In order to improve the precision of estimates
for minorities, the NHIS uses a technique known as
oversampling.</p>

<p>23 In PSUs with between 5% and 50% minority population,
oversampling is incorporated into the survey design by
assigning segments to one of two strata according to the
proportion of the minority population. In the stratum with
high minority concentrations, the sampling rates for
segment selection are increased. In the other stratum of
the same PSU, the sampling rates are decreased. This is
done so that the sample size within each PSU is the same as
it would be if oversampling were not used. Oversampling was
used in 102 PSUs. According to Census Bureau estimates, the
proportion of persons in minority groups, for which
oversampling was done, was 16%. If oversampling had
not been used, the proportion would have been 11%.</p>

<p>24 In the third stage of the sampling design, the NCHS
selects households at which the survey will be administered
by one of the 140 interviewers. If there is a manageable
number of households in a segment, an interview is
attempted at each occupied household within each segment
included in the sample. Otherwise, if there is a large
number of households in a segment, a sample of households
is chosen to be interviewed. The response rate for
households that are selected to be in the sample has
continually been over 95%. In 1993, the NHIS consisted of
43,007 households containing 109,671 people.</p>

<h2>2.3 Sampling Weights</h2>

<p>25 Each person included in the sample has a known
positive probability of selection for the survey. After the
survey is completed, the probability of selection is
adjusted (e.g., for nonresponse) to produce the final
sampling weights. Using these sampling weights, the data
can be used to represent the total United States
population. The sampling weight for each person in the
sample defines the number of individuals in the population
that he or she represents. For the 1993 NHIS sample, the
sampling weights are between 230 and 11,694, with the
median weight at 2,052.</p>

<p>26 For each person in the sample, a <i>basic</i>
statistical weight is made up of three components,
corresponding to the three sampling stages. Let
<i>p<sub>i</sub></i> denote the probability that the
<i>i<sup>th</sup></i> PSU is selected, <i>p<sub>j</sub></i>
denote the probability that the <i>j<sup>th</sup></i>
segment is selected, and <i>p<sub>k</sub></i> denote the
probability that the <i>k<sup>th</sup></i> household is
selected. The basic statistical weight,
<i>w</i><sup>*</sup><i><sub>ijk</sub></i>, for individuals
in the <i>i<sup>th</sup></i> PSU, <i>j<sup>th</sup></i>
segment, and <i>k<sup>th</sup></i> household, is defined
as</p>

<p></p><center>
<img src="./single_8_1_files/weight.gif" alt="\begin{displaymath}{w^*}_{ijk} = \frac{1}{p_{i}} \times \frac{1}{p_{j}} \times\frac{1}{p_{k}}.\end{displaymath}" height="47" width="168"></center><p></p>

<p>27 Three ratio adjustments are applied to the basic
statistical weight in order to adjust for any nonresponse
of households within a segment, to help correct any bias
due to undercoverage, and to make the sample more closely
resemble the age, sex, and race distribution in the
population. These ratios are derived from independent data
sources by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The resulting
<i>final</i> weight for the <i>i<sup>th</sup></i>
individual in the survey will be denoted as
<i>w<sub>i</sub></i>, and is equal to the number of people
in the target population represented by the
<i>i<sup>th</sup></i> individual in the survey.</p>

<a name="section3"><h1>3. Accessing NHIS Data</h1></a>

<p>28 The Federal Electronic Research and Review Extraction
Tool (FERRET) provides an interface for accessing data from
the NHIS over the Internet. FERRET was developed by the
U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. A link to FERRET is located at the NCHS web
site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/gate/singlelink2.html">
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/datawh/ferret/ferret.htm</a>. 
Alternatively, the data are available on CD-ROM from the
NCHS  (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#nhis">National Health Interview Survey
1993</a>).</p>

<p>29 Using FERRET, you can select variables, view or
download a codebook for the variables, and download either
a SAS or an ASCII dataset. FERRET has a search engine that
allows you to identify variables of interest from the NHIS
dataset. You can generate cross-tabulations or frequency
distributions for the variables that you select over the
web and can choose to create these descriptive statistics
using statistically weighted or unweighted data.</p>

<p>30 The information in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table2">Table

<a name="section4"><h1>4. Using the NHIS as a Teaching Tool</h1></a>

<h2>4.1 Introduction</h2>

<p>31 A discussion of the three stages of the NHIS sampling
design provides examples of sampling frames, target
populations, stratification, and sampling. Accessibility
via the Internet allows the NHIS to serve as an example and
a teaching tool for statistics classes at various levels.</p>

<p>32 One of the best ways to help students understand
surveys and sampling is to get them to think about and
discuss the issues involved in carrying out a survey. For
example, students (or groups of students) can be asked to
design a survey that would measure some health-related
outcome in the U.S. population. Along with the actual
survey questions, they can be asked to consider how they
might achieve a nationally representative sample. Each
student (or group) can exchange their proposal with another
student (or group) to critique their respective plans.
Students can assess their classmates' plans for potential
bias, under or over representation, and feasibility. This
exercise helps students understand what is involved in
making a sample representative of a target population, when
the target population is large and geographically diverse.
In particular, it helps increase students' appreciation of
the sampling design issues in the NHIS. Explaining that the
NHIS is administered yearly, and that the resulting data
are subsequently used for research and health policy,
provides some perspective for the students.</p>

<p>33 A discussion about sampling frames can be enhanced by
considering the difference between a list frame (an
identification, or listing, of elements from the population
of interest) and an area frame (an identification of
subsets of elements, defined geographically, from the
population of interest). As mentioned in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#section2.2">Section 2.2</a>, the
NHIS uses a sampling frame consisting of geographic areas.
It is interesting to note that, although the U.S. Bureau of
the Census conducts the NHIS, it does not use a list frame
compiled from the list of addresses in the decennial
census. The Census Bureau must guarantee the
confidentiality of information collected in the decennial
census, and, under Title 13 of United States Code, is not
allowed to release any identifiable household information
to other Federal statistical agencies. Without this
identifiable information, it would not be possible for the
NCHS to analyze the results of the NHIS in sufficient
geographical detail or to conduct follow-up surveys. These
are the major reasons why an area sampling frame is used
for conducting the NHIS.</p>

<p>34 Stratified sampling is a topic that appears in most
introductory courses. The sampling design of the NHIS
provides a good example of the use and importance of
stratification. In the first stage of the sampling design,
the non-self-representing PSUs (those PSUs that are not
automatically selected into the sample) are clustered into
73 strata. Then two PSUs are selected from each stratum.
Stratifying variables used by the NHIS include poverty
status, ethnic origin, urban/non-urban area, and employment
status. The choice of stratifying variables is an excellent
discussion topic. What makes a variable a good choice as a
stratifying variable? If the major concern of the survey
were financial issues rather than health issues, how would
this affect the choice of stratification variables?</p>

<p>35 Information such as that in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table2">Table 2</a> can be used to
introduce or reinforce the idea of sampling weights. In a
probability class, the composition of the sampling weights
can be used to provide an example of independence in an
interesting applied probability setting. In most college
statistics courses, students are primarily exposed to equal
probability sampling. Because of this, and
misrepresentation in the media, students may misinterpret
unequal probability sampling as incorrect or "biased" (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#overton">Overton and Stehman
1995</a>).</p>

<p>36 A discussion of the design issues in the NHIS can be
used to emphasize the fact that the probability of
selection must be known for each sampled individual in any
valid probability sampling design. Also, students can see
how the sampling design along with the probability of
selection makes it possible for estimates from the data to
be representative of the target population. For example,
using the data in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table2">Table 2</a>,
students can investigate the national sex distribution
across age groups. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table2">Table
2</a>, the 5,010 females aged 18-24 represent 12,242,939
women in the target population, or 50.72% of those
in this age group. Thus, on average, each woman in this age
group represents approximately 2,444 women. In other words,
the average statistical weight for women in this age group
is approximately 2,444.</p>

<p>37 In addition, the NHIS can be used to introduce the
concept of weighted means. For example, suppose that
<i>x<sub>i</sub></i> represents the height of the
<i>i<sup>th</sup></i> individual in the survey. Then, using
the final statistical weights, an estimate of the average
height of males aged 18-24, <img src="./single_8_1_files/sumh.gif" alt="$\bar{x}$" border="0" height="16" width="15" align="BOTTOM">,
in the target population is given by the following weighted
mean</p>

<p></p><center>
<p>
<img src="./single_8_1_files/meanh.gif" alt="\begin{displaymath}\bar{x}= \frac{ \sum_{males,18-24}{w_i}{x_i} }{ \sum_{males,18-24}{w_i} }.\end{displaymath}" height="51" width="172"></p></center><p></p>

<p>Note that the numerical value of the denominator,
11,895,851, appears in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table2">Table
2</a>.  Most statistical packages allow the user to
specify weights to be used in constructing
cross-tabulations and in the calculation of means and
totals.</p>

<p>38 In an advanced class or as an independent study, the
NHIS can be used to provide context and the data source for
investigations of variance estimation in a complex survey.
Potential topics include the jackknife estimator of the
variance, the use of alternative statistical packages, and
the Horvitz-Thompson Theorem for means and variances from
probability samples (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#overton">Overton and Stehman 1995</a>).
Most general purpose statistical packages do not
incorporate complex survey design features in their
calculation of variances. This typically leads to
underestimates of the variances. Software packages such as
SUDAAN (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#shah">Shah, Barnwell, and
Bieler 1997</a>) do provide this capability. Results from
these packages or printed reports (e.g., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#benson">Benson and Marano 1994</a>) can
be used as a benchmark for these investigations.</p>

<h2>4.2 Two Examples Using FERRET</h2>

<p>39 To facilitate the use of FERRET and the NHIS as a
teaching tool, two examples are presented below. The
examples begin with a research question. They continue with
an explanation of how FERRET can be used to retrieve
information from the NHIS that can be used to address the
question. The first example involves analyses conducted
over the Internet using FERRET. An instructor might
generate the output from this example and distribute it to
students, or have students generate the output themselves.
The second example is for a more advanced audience. It
discusses a situation where a dataset is downloaded and
imported into a statistical analysis package. An instructor
might download the data and distribute it to students or
have students download their own data in an advanced
class.</p>

<p>40 As a first example, the following question will be
considered. Are there regional or gender differences in the
amount of salt that young adults add to their food? To extract information from the NHIS, the "Year 2000"
supplement is selected from FERRET's <i>Survey Form
Page</i>. FERRET then brings the user to the <i>Data Search
Page</i> to identify variables of interest. A search of the
variable names and descriptions was done for the following
terms: age, region, sex, and salt. The variables AGER1 (age
recode #1), REGION, SEX, and ADDSALT (how often add salt to
food) were then selected from the <i>Select Variables
Page</i>. The codebook for these variables, generated by
FERRET, is given below:</p>

<p><b>AGER1 (AGE RECODE #1)</b>
<br>3 18-24 years
<br>4 25-44 years
<br>5 45-64 years
<br>6 65-69 years
<br>7 70-74 years
<br>8 75 years and over</p>

<p><b>ADDSALT (HOW OFTEN ADD SALT TO FOOD)</b>
<br>1 Always
<br>2 Often
<br>3 Sometimes
<br>4 Rarely
<br>5 Never
<br>8 Not ascertained
<br>9 DK or refused</p>

<p><b>REGION (REGION)</b>
<br>1 Northeast
<br>2 Midwest
<br>3 South
<br>4 West</p>

<p><b>SEX (SEX)</b>
<br>1 Male
<br>2 Female</p>

<p>41 From the <i>Select Variable Values Page</i>, the 18-24
year age group, non-missing values for the ADDSALT
variable, the Northeast and South regions, and all values
for the SEX variable were selected. Selecting a
cross-tabulation with ADDSALT as the column variable,
REGION as the row variable, SEX as the page variable, and
using the final basic statistical weight, produced the
results in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table3">Table 3</a>. Note
that the use of statistical weights is the default option
when creating a cross-tabulation. Students can then begin
to address the research question using the information
generated by FERRET.</p>

<p>42 As a second example, the following question will be
considered. Are there regional differences in the amount of
medical utilization for young adults? To address this
question, the variable DV12, the number of doctor visits in
the past twelve months, will be used. Since this variable
is ordinal and has a large number of possible values, it is
not well suited for description in a cross-tabulation.
Therefore, the data will be downloaded using FERRET and
analyzed using a separate statistical package. Depending on
the other variables to be used, either the "Person File" or
the "Year 2000" supplement could be used. In this example,
the "Person File" was selected from the <i>Survey Form
Page</i>. On the <i>Data Search Page</i> the following
terms were entered: region, age, doctor visits, and wtfa
(WTFA is the final statistical weight on the "Person
File"). The variables AGER1, REGION, DV12, and WTFA were
then selected. The codebook for the variable DV12 is listed
below.  As an example, a value of 3 indicates that there
were three visits in the past year.</p>

<p><b>DV12 (DOCTOR VISITS IN PAST 12 MONTHS)</b>
<br>000 None
<br>001-996 Visits
<br>997 997+ Visits
<br>998 Unknown</p>

<p>43 The 18-24 year age group, all values for REGION and
values of DV12 between 0 and 997 were selected from the
<i>Select Variable Values Page</i>. The "Create Ascii file
for downloading" option was then selected. These data were
then imported into a statistical package (such as SPSS,
SAS, or STATA). The results in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table4">Table 4</a> were generated using

<p>44 Students can begin to address the research question by
considering the quantiles, percentages, and means in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table4">Table 4</a>. A more advanced
class could consider the treatment of outliers such as the
maximum value in the Northeast of 360 doctor visits. This
might bring up topics such as the use of a trimmed mean.
Further investigation could include stratifying the
analysis by various demographic variables such as sex,
income, and smoking status.</p>

<p>45 Students in an independent study or an advanced class
could generate confidence intervals using software such as
SUDAAN or by constructing jackknife estimates of the
standard error. The standard errors in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table4">Table 4</a> were generated in SAS
using the variables CSTRATUM and CPSU as described in
"Method 1 - Single Stage PSUs Sampled With Replacement

<p>46 There is a wealth of information contained in the data
collected by the NHIS. There are countless investigations
that can be performed using these data. To facilitate the
use of the NHIS for class projects, some of the variables
that are available on the "Person file" and the "Year 2000"
supplement of the NHIS are listed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064031/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/single.cfm#table5">Table 5</a>.</p>
