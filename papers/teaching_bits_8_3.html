<h3>"The Super Bowl Theory: Fourth and Long"</h3>  
<p>by Paul M. Sommers (2000).
<cite>The College Mathematics Journal</cite>, 31(3), 189-192.</p>

<p>The author notes that the Super Bowl Theory (that there
is a reliable correlation between stock market performance
and Super Bowl results) was surprisingly accurate and
reliable in the early years of the Super Bowl. The theory
has produced unreliable predictions in recent years.  The
article presents a dataset that contains Super Bowl and Dow
Jones data from 1967 to 1998, describes a regression model
based on the theory, and provides an example of how to
assess the explanatory power of the theory.</p>

<h3>"<i>t</i>-Probabilities as Finite Sums"</h3> 
<p>by Neil Eklund (2000).
<cite>The College Mathematics Journal</cite>, 31(3), 217-218.</p>

<p>The author illustrates how the expression for the
<i>t</i>-probability formula can be written as a finite
sum.  The finite-sum expression can be used to write a
program for a programmable calculator to accurately
determine the probability for a given <i>t</i>-value and
degrees of freedom.</p>


<h3>"Food and Drug Interaction: What Role Does Statistics Play?"</h3>  
<p>by Tom Bradstreet (2000).
<cite>The College Mathematics Journal</cite>, 31(4),
268-273.</p>

<p>The author describes and provides data from a study that
was conducted to investigate the magnitude of the food
interaction of a new drug.  An example of how the dataset
can be used to illustrate normal theory ANOVA with
subsequent confidence intervals is provided.  The author
states that the dataset can also be used to illustrate the
ideas of paired vs. independent data, hypothesis testing
procedures for the paired <i>t</i>-test, the Wilcoxon
signed rank test and the corresponding Hodges-Lehmann
estimator and Moses confidence interval, outliers,
exploratory data analysis methodologies, and the use of
graphical displays. A URL is provided at the end of the
article for access to twenty-two other datasets.</p>

<p>by Michael P. Cohen (2000). 
<cite>Journal of  Educational and Behavioral
Statistics</cite>, 25(2), 249-252.</p>


<p>The note does not provide an explanation of the odds
ratio, although the author provides useful references. The
author provides examples that can be used in the classroom
to help students learn the similarities and differences
between the odds ratio and the probability ratio (relative
risk), and to help students to start thinking in terms of
odds ratios.</p>

<h3>"Making Sense of the Total of Two Dice"</h3> 
<p>by Dave Pratt (2000). 
<cite>Journal for Research in Mathematical
Education</cite>, 31(5), 602-625.

</p><p>Abstract: Many studies have shown that the strategies
used in making judgments of chance are subject to
systematic bias.  Concerning chance and randomness, little
is known about the relationship between the external
structuring resources, made available for example in a
pedagogic environment, and the construction of new internal
resources.  In this study I used a novel approach in which
young children articulated their meaning for chance through
their attempts to "mend" possibly broken computer-based
stochastic gadgets.  I describe the interplay between
informal intuitions and computer-based resources as the
children constructed new internal resources for making
sense of the total of 2 spinners and 2 dice.</p>

<h3>"Applying Cognitive Theory to Statistics
Instruction"</h3> 
<p> by Marsha C. Lovett and Joel B. Greenhouse (2000).   
<cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 54(3), 
196-206.</p>

<p>Abstract:  This article presents five principles of
learning, derived from cognitive theory and supported by
empirical results in cognitive psychology. To bridge the
gap between theory and practice, each of these principles
is transformed into a practical guideline and exemplified
in a real teaching context.  It is argued that this
approach of putting cognitive theory into practice can
offer several benefits to statistics education: a means for
explaining and understanding why reform efforts work; a set
of guidelines that can help instructors make well-informed
design decisions when implementing these reforms; and a
framework for generating new and effective instructional
innovations.</p>

<h3>"Collections of Simple Effects and Their Relationship
to Main Effects and Interactions in Factorials"</h3> 
<p>by Oliver Schabenberger, Timothy G. Gregoire, and Fanzhi
Kong (2000).
<cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 54(3), 210-214.</p>

<p>Abstract: When analyzing data from a cross-classified
experiment, one of the primary interests lies in estimating
and testing main effects and interactions. Frequently, one
is also interested in comparing the levels of one factor at
a given level of another factor, particularly if
interactions are present.  Such collections of simple main
effects are termed <i>slices</i> herein.  Based on unfolded
designs in which effects are represented by generic sets of
orthogonal contrasts among cell means, the relationships
between the contrast sets defining main effects,
interactions, and slices in terms of Kronecker
representations and projection properties are examined. 
The material is appropriate in a first course on linear
models and/or a course in experimental design with linear
algebra prerequisite to demonstrate the relationship and
interpretation of various effects in a factorial setting.
An example from production quality control is
presented.</p>

<h3>"The Mighty Bonus Point"</h3> 
<p>by George D. Kesling (2000).
<cite>The American Statistician</cite>, 54(3), 215-216.</p>

<p>Abstract: This article suggests a small change in
grading that can cause a big change in learning í- "the
mighty bonus point." Bonus points that contribute no more
than two percent of a studentás grade can help create a
group atmosphere where everyone helps the group.  Bonus
points are awarded for outstanding contributions to the
class and are used to encourage peer tutoring and general
group learning.</p>

<h2>Teaching Statistics, Autumn 2000<br>
Volume 22, Number 3</h2>


<p><b>"CensusAtSchool 2000"</b> by Doreen Connor, Neville
Davies, and Peter Holmes, 66-70.</p>

<p>Abstract:  The article covers the development of an
ambitious Internet-based project to conduct a simple census
of the schoolchildren of England and Wales linked to the
2001 UK National Census.</p>

<p><b>"Do the Lengths of Pebbles on Hastings Beach Follow a
Normal Distribution?"</b> by Anne Brooks, 73-76.</p>

<p>The author describes a research activity conducted with
secondary school students.  The task involved the
collection of some 600 pebbles from a beach in order to
estimate the distribution of the pebble lengths.  Students
learned about the characteristics of a normal distribution
within a real-life context.  In addition, the activity
provided experience in dealing with large datasets,
generating graphs, calculating statistics, identification
and use of appropriate data collection and analysis
techniques, interpretation of results, statistical
decision-making, and communication of findings.</p> 

<p><b>"The Case Against Histograms"</b> by David L.
Farnsworth, 81-85.</p>

<p>The author describes a homework assignment that
illustrates to students how decisions about the number of
intervals and interval widths to use when creating
histograms can influence inferences about the shape of a
distribution.</p>

<p><b>"Learning Statistics on the Web í- DISCUSS"</b> by
Neville Hunt and Sidney Tyrrell, 85-90.</p>

<p>Abstract: This article discusses the use of the Internet
in teaching and learning statistics and describes how
interactive spreadsheets can be integrated with Web-based
resources.</p>

<p><b>"On Simulation and the Teaching of Statistics"</b> by
Ted Hodgson and Maurice Burke, 90-96.</p>

<p>Abstract: The use of simulation as an instructional tool
can promote a deep conceptual understanding of statistics
and lead to misunderstandings. Teachers need to be aware of
the misconceptions that can arise as a result of simulation
and carefully structure classroom activities so as to
derive the benefits of this powerful instructional
tool.</p>

<h2>"Study Disputes Success of the Brady Law"</h2>

<p>by Fox Butterfield, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 2
August 2000, p. 12.</p>


<h2>"Two Economists Give Far Higher Cost of Gun Violence"</h2>

<p>by Fox Butterfield, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 15 September 2000, p. 12.</p>

<p>The first article is based on a study in the
<cite>Journal of the American  Medical Association</cite>
("Homicide and Suicide Rates Associated With 
Implementation of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention
Act" by Jens  Ludwig and Philip J. Cook, <cite>JAMA</cite>,
2 August 2000, Vol. 284, No. 5, pp. 585-591).  Gun
homicides have declined overall since the Brady law was 
passed.  However, 18 states already had background checks
and waiting  periods before the law was enacted, while 32
states enacted such  restrictions in response to the law. 
If the law were really having a  positive effect, one might
expect the latter group to show a faster rate  of decline
in gun homicide.  But the study did not find such an
effect.</p>

<p>The Clinton administration joined Brady law supporters
in criticizing  the study.  They point out that the study
did not explicitly consider the  possible effects that the
Brady law may have had on the 18  "control"  states.
Specifically, as the authors of the study themselves 
acknowledged,  "...it is possible that the Brady Act may
have had a  negative association with homicide rates in
both the treatment and  control states by reducing the flow
of guns from treatment-state gun  dealers into secondary
gun markets."  The secondary gun markets referred  to here
include gun shows and private sales, which are not subject
to  the Brady law.  Such transactions account for an
estimated 30 to 40% of the gun market.</p>

<p>The second article describes Ludwig and Cook's recently
published book  <cite>Gun Violence: The Real Costs</cite>
(Oxford University Press).  The central  thesis of the book
is that the real costs of gun violence far exceed the 
medical costs and lost workplace productivity of gunshot
victims.  The  authors' total cost estimate of $100 billion
a year is based on a  technique that economists call
"contingent valuation," which assesses  how much it is
worth to people to avoid a problem.  The authors  conducted
a telephone survey of 1200 people, asking them how much
they  would pay annually to reduce criminal gunshot
injuries.  This led to an  estimate of $80 billion
nationally.  The remaining $20 billion was  derived from
previous analyses of lost productivity and the use of  jury
awards to place a value on a lost life.</p>

<p>Critics of the book note that Ludwig and Cook's
accounting fails to  include any benefits of guns.  They
also question the highly  subjective element of putting a
dollar value on a human life.</p>

<h2>"Behind the Good News on Cancer There's the Same Old Bad News"</h2>

<p>by H. Gilbert Welch, <cite>The Los Angeles Times</cite>, 19 July 2000, p. 9.</p>

<p>What is the right measure of progress in the war on
cancer?  One widely  quoted statistic is the five-year
survival rate, defined as the  proportion of people alive
five years after being diagnosed with the  disease.  Welch
was a co-author of an article in the <cite>Journal of the 
American Medical Association</cite> that questioned the
usefulness of this  statistic (Welch, Schwartz, and
Woloshin, "Are Increasing 5-Year Survival  Rates Evidence
of Success Against Cancer?" <cite>JAMA</cite>, 14 June
2000, Vol. 283,  No. 22, pp. 2965-2978).  In the
<cite>Times</cite> article, he presents two simple 
examples to illustrate that the survival rate can increase
even when  there has been no change in the effectiveness of
treatment.</p>

<p>The first way this can happen occurs when new tests for
a particular  cancer permit earlier detection of the
disease.  Welsh asks us to  imagine a group of men who died
of prostate cancer at age 78, the  current median age of
death for men with this disease.  If these men had  been
diagnosed to have prostate cancer at age 75, their
five-year  survival rate would be 0. But if they had been
diagnosed with the  disease at age 70, this rate would be
100%.  In other words, early  detection of a disease can
cause the five-year survival rate to increase  even with no
change in the way the disease is treated.</p>

<p>A second problem with using survival rate is the fact
that some cancers  have both progressive and
non-progressive forms.  In the progressive  form, the
disease can progress to the point where it is life-
threatening.  In the non-progressive form, there will
typically be no  symptoms, and the disease will not result
in death.  Prostate cancer is  an example.  Before the
recent trend towards aggressive testing,  virtually all
patients diagnosed with prostate cancer would have 
exhibited symptoms of the progressive form.  Thus if 1000
men were  diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1950 and 400 of
them were alive five  years later, the five-year survival
rate would be 40%.  But with the new  diagnostic tests for
prostate cancer, if 1000 men are found to have  prostate
cancer, some of these will have the non-progressive form
and  thus not be at risk of death from the disease.  As
before, this will  increase the observed survival rate even
if there is no change in the  treatment of the disease.</p>

<p>The original <cite>JAMA</cite> article compares data for
the five-year survival rate,  the mortality rate, and the
incidence rate for 20 forms of cancer for  1950-1954 and
1989-1995.  The results are presented in the following

<p>Observe how the trends in the five-year survival rates

<h2>"TV Advertising Drives Fight Over Size of Spanish Audience"</h2>

<p>by Jayson Blair, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 17 July 2000, A1.</p>


<p>Univision, the largest Spanish-language television
broadcaster in the  US, has charged that Spanish-speaking
households are underrepresented in  the sample used for
Nielsen ratings in the New York area.  There are 6.8 
million households with televisions in this area, about 1
million of  which are estimated to be Hispanic.  Nielsen
has viewing meters in a  total of 500 households.  Although
Nielsen believes its sample includes  a reasonable fraction
of Hispanic households, officials acknowledge that  their
ratings do not distinguish households that speak primarily 
Spanish.</p>

<p>To further investigate the language issue, Nielsen
conducted a door-to-door survey to estimate the size of the
primarily Spanish-speaking  population.  Their results
indicated that 43 of the 500 viewing-meters  should be
placed in "Spanish-dominant" households, whereas currently 
there are only 21. Needless to say, English-language
broadcasters were  not pleased with the prospect of losing
meters from English-speaking   households.  They criticized
the methodology of the language survey,  because
interviewers initiated conversations in Spanish and
allegedly  asked leading questions.  Nielsen agrees that
more research should have  been done into "Spanish-language
polling techniques," but still feels  that Spanish-speaking
households are being undercounted.  Nevertheless,  concerns
about the survey have convinced Nielsen to put on hold
their  plans to change the meter locations.</p>

<p>Apart from the survey, there is reason to believe that
Univision's  concerns may be justified.  The article
reports that since 1995 Nielsen  has maintained a separate
rating called the Nielsen Hispanic index  (NHI), which it
believes gives a more accurate account of Hispanic 
viewership.  Nielsen's primary rating service is called the
Nielsen  station index (NSI).  Reproduced below is a
comparison from a  sidebar  to the article.  It shows

<h2>"Vegetarians Are More Likely to Have Daughters"</h2>

<p>by Helen Rumblelow, <cite>The Times</cite> (London), 7 August 2000.</p>

<h2>"Plant Chemicals Could Play Small Part in Deciding Gender"</h2>

<p>by Dr. Thomas Stuttaford, <cite>The Times</cite> (London), 7 August 2000.</p>

<p>Both articles concern a 1998 study of nearly 6000
pregnant women in  Nottingham, England, 5% of whom did not
eat meat or fish. Among the vegetarians, the ratio of boy
babies to girl babies was 85 to 100,  while for the meat
and fish eaters, the ratio was 106 to 100. According  to
the articles, the second ratio reflects the overall
national average  for Great Britain. </p>

<p>The only other study on how diet affects the sex of
offspring showed  that high levels of magnesium,
potassium, and calcium result in more  boys.  However,
there is no evidence that vegetarian diets are low in 
these elements. The new study also found that vegetarians
are less  likely to smoke during pregnancy than
non-vegetarians (10% versus  25%).  Previous research had
indicated that nonsmokers tend to  produce more boys. One
of the researchers from the new study is quoted  as saying,
"If diet is the factor that lowers the sex ratio in 
vegetarians, it would appear that this effect overrides the
effect of  vegetarians' low smoking rate in pregnancy."
</p>

<p>The second article also presented some historical
beliefs about what  affects the sex of a child. At the
beginning of the 20th century, "it was  firmly believed
that an  older father, or one married to a very strong, 
domineering woman,  was likely to have boys." The fact that
servicemen  returning from  World War II tended to father
more boys than other men  was seen as supporting this
idea.  Further support was found in studies  of Burke's
Peerage. "The habit for centuries was for the rich to take
a  bride considerably younger than themselves, whereas in
poor families  marriage was  earlier, and the ages closer.
As recorded in Burke's, the  aristocracy had more sons."

<h2>"Putting Rankings to the Test:  US News's College
Evaluations  Questioned"</h2>

<p>by Jay Mathews, <cite>The Washington Post</cite>, 25
August 2000, C1.</p>


<p><cite>The Post</cite> describes the annual <cite>US News
&amp; World Report</cite> college rankings  issue as "a source
of gastrointestinal distress for college presidents, 
alumni  fundraisers and professional statisticians."  The
article cites  a 1997 report prepared for <cite>US
News</cite> by the National Opinion Research  Center (NORC)
in Chicago.  Echoing some long-standing concerns of 
outside critics, the report states that "the principal
weakness of the  current approach is that the weights used
to combine the various  measures into an  overall rating
lack any defensible empirical or  theoretical  basis."  The
selection of factors to include in the  formulas was also
criticized.  For example, there are no direct measures  of
quality of the curriculum or of student experience.</p>

<p><cite>The Post</cite> received a copy of the NORC report
from Nicholas Thompson of  the <cite>Washington
Monthly</cite>.  Thompson's own commentary, entitled
"Playing  With Numbers:  How U.S. News Mismeasures Higher
Education and What We Can Do About It," can be read
on-line at</p>

http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2000/0009.thompson.html</a>
</blockquote>

<p>At this site you can find the NORC report and a response
from <cite>US News</cite>.   You will also find the text of
a famous 1997 letter from former Stanford  president
Gerhard Casper, who wrote to <cite>US News</cite>:  "I hope
I have the  standing to persuade you that much about these 
rankings -- particularly  their specious formulas and
spurious  precision -- is utterly  misleading."  One of the
primary concerns of the NORC report is the lack  of
research on the statistical properties of the <cite>US
News</cite> estimators.   According to NORC, <cite>US
News</cite> has not even performed a simple correlation 
analysis on the components of its formulas.

</p><p>Thompson himself laments the "beauty contest" mentality
promoted by the  rankings issue.  He further worries about
what he calls the  "Heisenberg  effect"; that is, colleges
may actually institute changes in response to  the <cite>US
News</cite> rating categories.  Admissions officials are
certainly aware  of the power of the  rankings.  They see
application rates and yield go  up when their  school rises
in the rankings; drops in the rankings have  the  opposite
effect. Thompson cites findings by the National Bureau  
for Economic Research (NBER) that quantify the yield
effect:  to  compensate for the decreased yield resulting
from a one-place drop in  the rankings, a school would need
to increase its admissions rate by 0.4  the following
year.</p> 

<p>Readers of last year's rankings may recall Caltech's
surprising leap to  the number one spot among national
universities.  Thompson provides some  details on how this
came about.  The pivotal change came in the 
spending-per-student measure.  In prior years, it had
entered the  formula through ranks. But last year, absolute
dollar amounts were used.   To illustrate, Thompson cites
data from 1997.  Caltech was the runaway  leader, spending
$74,000 per student.  Yale was fourth with  $45,000 and 
Harvard seventh with $43,000.  In terms of ranks, Caltech's
three-position advantage over Yale is the same as Yale's
lead over Harvard.   But in absolute numbers, Caltech spent
40% more than Harvard,  whereas Harvard and Yale were
nearly the same.  The switch to absolute  dollars gave
Caltech a dramatic advantage last year.  Thompson  reports
that this change caused serious internal disputes at
<cite>US News</cite>.

<h2>"The Wild Poll Pendulum"</h2>

<p>by William Safire, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 28 September 2000, A27.</p>


<p>In this essay, Safire protests the unreasonable
volatility of polling  results, and the way that news
stories are crafted to respond to them.   He questions
whether Al Gore's celebrated kiss with his wife Tipper 
really propelled him into the lead, only to be countered
when George  Bush kissed Oprah Winfrey on her talk
show.</p>  

<p>One source of difficulty, says Safire, is the pressure
the media feel to  actually have a story about which
candidate is "winning" at any given  point in time.  Not
content to report a large "undecided" number,  polling
organizations feel compelled to follow up with questions
about  who voters are "leaning towards."  The flip side of
this coin is that  people do not like to appear uninformed,
so they are easily pushed into  taking some sort of stand.
Safire wonders how much of the perceived  volatility in the
electorate is simply the result of changes in such 
"leanings" among voters who have legitimately not made up
their minds.</p>

<p>Safire is, of course, famously concerned with precise
use of language.   Here he worries about what is left
unsaid when polling results talk  about the number of
"respondents."  He states that in 1984, a 65%  response
rate was typical, whereas today some of his friends in the 
polling community quietly admit that the rate is now as low
as 35%.  He  suspects that the use of answering machines or
caller ID is allowing  potential respondents to screen
their calls.</p>

<p>As I write this, the election is over, though we still
do not know who  the next president will be!  In hindsight,
maybe it is not surprising  that the polls were not able to
pin down a winner.</p>

<p>The debate about how to interpret the results in Florida
is likely to  continue for some time.  Here is a web site
that has catalogued a number  of the fascinating
statistical analyses that have been done to date:</p>

<h2>"Failed Firestone Tires Seem Worse on Rear Driver's Side"</h2>

<p>by Justin Hyde (Associated Press), <cite>The Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel</cite>, 24  September 2000, A1.</p>


<p>The article reports on analysis done by Keith
Baumgardner, a consultant  who is studying data on
Firestone tires in connection with lawsuits that  have been
brought against that tire-maker and Ford Motor Company.
Baumgardner has seen 63 cases of tread separation on Ford
Explorers.  Of  these, 45 involved rear tires -- 27 on the
driver's side and 18 on the  passenger's side.  The other
18 either involved front tires or their  position was not
known. </p>

<p>Ford spokesman Ken Zino acknowledged that the company is
aware of a  slight trend toward rear tire failure and is
working to identify the  cause.  Another Ford spokesman,
Mike Vaught, reported that several  theories were being
considered:</p>

    <blockquote>The location of the Explorer's fuel tank on
    the  left side might put more weight on that
    wheel.</blockquote> 

    <blockquote>The rotation of the Explorer's drive shaft
    might  place more force on the left side than the
    right.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>American roads might radiate more heat from
    the  center of the pavement than from the edges,
    increasing the heat transferred to the driver's  side
    tires.</blockquote>

<p>Vaught stressed, however, that the investigation was
still in its early  stages, and that these theories did not
contradict Ford's position that the tires themselves were
to blame, not the design of the Explorer.</p>

<p>You can find additional information on the National
Highway Traffic  Safety Administration (NHTSA) web
site:</p>

<p>There you can find a database of complaints regarding
Firestone ATX and  Wilderness tires.  As of an October 24
update, there were 3700 reports.  The information is

<h2>"Studies Find Race Disparities in Texas Traffic Stops"</h2>

<p>by Jim Yardley, <cite>The New York Times</cite>, 7 October 2000, A12.</p>


<p>In recent years, the controversial use of racial
profiling on New Jersey  highways has received wide media
attention.  The present article describes  studies
conducted in Texas by the NAACP and by the <cite>Dallas
Morning News</cite>.  Both examined the rates at which
African-Americans, Hispanics, and  whites were ticketed and
searched on Texas roadways.  The <cite>Morning News</cite> 
looked at the 859,000 traffic tickets issued in Texas over
the last  year, while the NAACP focused on 65,000 drivers
who were stopped during  the month of March.  Their
findings were similar.  According to the  article, "Black
and Hispanic motorists across Texas are more than twice  as
likely as non-Hispanic whites to be  searched during
traffic stops,  while black drivers  in certain rural areas
of the state are also far  more likely to be ticketed..."
</p>

<p>Although the <cite>Dallas Morning News</cite> found that
statewide, African-Americans  and Hispanics received
tickets "at rates that were proportional to their 
driving-age populations," they also concluded that in many
rural counties, blacks were ticketed nearly twice as often
as non-Hispanic  whites. In response, the Texas Department
of Public Safety said the  study was flawed because, as the
article states:</p>

      <blockquote>It compared the race and number of
      ticketed drivers  with the local population where the
      stop occurred,  but didn't consider that the drivers
      might be from elsewhere.</blockquote>

<p>The state's own analysis reportedly shows that
non-Hispanic white  drivers are stopped more often "than
their estimated state wide  population," but that blacks
and Hispanics are twice as likely to be  searched.</p>
