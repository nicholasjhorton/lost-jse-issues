<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Courses taught using problem-based learning methods give
life sciences graduate students direct practice in the
statistical reasoning skills needed to choose appropriate
procedures for analyzing data from their research studies.
This paper describes a graduate-level, case-based
biostatistics course designed to cultivate these skills in
veterinary medical science students who have had some
initial preparation in statistics. The course gives
students practical experience by focusing on the analysis
of data from actual biomedical research studies. Student
evaluations indicated that this course improved the
students' ability to understand and apply statistical
methods in their research.</p>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>1 Most graduate programs in the life sciences require
one or more courses in biostatistics to prepare students to
conduct graduate and professional research. These students
are mainly concerned not with learning the mathematical
theory of statistics, but with learning how to use
statistics (e.g., how to develop a good experimental
design, how to choose an appropriate statistical procedure,
or how to interpret statistical results in a scientific
paper).</p>

<p>2 There has been criticism that traditional lectures do
not adequately develop these skills, and repeated calls
have been made for more effective teaching methods (<a href="#federer">Federer 1978</a>; <a href="#hogg">Hogg
1991</a>; <a href="#snee">Snee 1993</a>). A disadvantage of
the lecture approach is that it is fundamentally
subject-based rather than problem-based; that is, the focus
is on learning statistical concepts, not on the process of
using statistics to solve problems. Subject-based
approaches are efficient for dispensing content knowledge
because the instructor can control the amount of material
covered and can adapt the level of presentation to the
needs of the students. However, this careful structuring of
the course content may discourage further learning by
leaving students with the impression that they have learned
all that is worth knowing about statistics. Moreover, if
the statistical concepts are not integrated with their
discipline knowledge, it may be difficult for students to
recall and apply these concepts later.</p>

<p>3 These deficiencies of the lecture approach are
conspicuously evident to me from my perspective of nearly
twenty years as a statistical consultant in an academic
setting. Despite the best intentions and efforts of my
colleagues who are more heavily engaged in classroom
teaching, my experience has been that most students have
forgotten all but a few catch phrases from their
introductory statistics course within a year or two of its
completion. More importantly, many students fail to make
the connection between statistical reasoning and scientific
inquiry. These students do not view statistics as integral
to the design and interpretation of research studies, but
merely as a source of significant <i>p</i>-values that must
be obtained to guarantee publication of their results (<a href="#salsburg">Salsburg 1985</a>).</p>

<p>4 Can the lecture approach be improved to promote
long-term learning and an appreciation of the key role of
statistics in scientific research? Some authors (<a href="#bradstreet">Bradstreet 1996</a>; <a href="#brightman">Brightman and Broida 1975</a>;  <a href="#chervany">Chervany, Benson, and Iyer 1980</a>) have
suggested that this can be accomplished by modifying the
lecture approach to teach statistical reasoning skills in
addition to statistical concepts. <a href="#cobb">Cobb
(1993)</a> has described twelve NSF-funded projects, ten of
which use active learning in their efforts to improve the
teaching of statistical thinking and statistical methods.
Incorporating active learning into lecture courses is a
recurring theme of papers appearing in <cite>Journal of
Statistics Education </cite>as well. Thus, the idea of
"learning by doing" is well established and its merits have
been demonstrated.</p>

<p>5 Notwithstanding the successes of active learning in a
lecture format, alternatives to the lecture format deserve
consideration. Student-centered approaches, such as
problem-based learning (PBL), may be even more effective in
developing statistical reasoning and problem-solving
skills. The second section of this paper gives a brief
overview of PBL methods. In the third section, I describe a
case-based biostatistics course designed for veterinary
medical science graduate students who have had some prior
exposure to statistical methods. The fourth section
illustrates one of the cases used in the course. The fifth
section summarizes student reactions to the course and
discusses problems in implementation and improvements
planned for future presentations of the course.</p>

<h1>2. Overview of Problem-Based Learning</h1>

<p>6 Educational theorists have demonstrated that knowledge
is recalled more easily, retained longer, and more readily
applied when the process of learning corresponds to the way
that the knowledge is to be used. PBL methods were
initially introduced in medical education in the 1960s (<a href="#barrows2">Barrows and Tamblyn 1980</a>) to
facilitate this way of learning. Medical students in a
traditional didactic curriculum learn anatomy, physiology,
and other basic medical sciences separately from the
clinical sciences that emphasize the diagnosis and
treatment of disease, whereas students in a PBL curriculum
learn the basic sciences by solving clinical problems. As
an example, students in a didactic curriculum learn about
diseases of the heart and related symptoms. In contrast,
students in a PBL curriculum are presented with a patient
showing symptoms and learn to reason from those symptoms to
determine their underlying cause and the basic science
structures and processes involved. The PBL approach clearly
emulates the diagnostic activity of a practicing physician
by proceeding from effect to cause. Several studies (<a href="#albanase">Albanase and Mitchell 1993</a>; <a href="#distlehorst">Distlehorst and Robbs 1998</a>; <a href="#vernon">Vernon and Blake 1993</a>) comparing
parallel didactic and PBL curricula have shown that PBL
students performed as well or better than
traditionally-educated students on such outcome measures as
the United States Medical Licensing Examination. Moreover,
the PBL students performed better in their clinical
clerkship and clinical practice examinations, thus
suggesting that PBL approaches teach some elements of
problem solving better than traditional approaches.</p>

<p>7 Regardless of the teaching method used, no statistics
course can expect to cover every topic that students will
need to know in order to conduct their future research.
When teaching is organized around a particular subject
area, instructors can have confidence that they are
including all the concepts and skills they feel the
students should learn. However, students' future needs for
statistical knowledge are not identical and the instructor
cannot anticipate every possible contingency. Many students
are comfortable with the subject-based approach because the
instructor delimits the breadth and depth of knowledge they
must acquire to complete the course successfully. Students
who accept this passive role remain dependent upon an
instructor to supply knowledge and are not motivated to
search out and organize knowledge for themselves. When
these students are challenged with a new data analysis
problem outside of the classroom setting, they are not
prepared to accept responsibility for extending their
current level of knowledge to discover a suitable solution.
These students then have the choice of seeking advice from
an expert on statistics (or someone who claims to be) or of
inappropriately forcing the new problem into the mold of
those studied previously.</p>

<p>8 With PBL methods, students learn to identify areas
where more knowledge is needed and to pursue self-directed
learning when faced with new problem situations. Thus PBL
methods are most suited to students who have the
self-discipline to take active responsibility for their own
learning. PBL methods may seem to be less efficient for
transmitting knowledge because they are more indirect than
subject-based methods; however, this deficiency can be
remedied by careful case selection. PBL cases that include
multiple potential courses of action give students
practical experience in choosing among competing
alternatives. This focus on the problem-solving process
helps students recognize whether they are facing a problem
that is within their present capabilities or one that
requires them to obtain additional knowledge.</p>

<p>9 <a href="#barrows1">Barrows (1986)</a> classified PBL
methods, as used in medical education, according to the
degree of student involvement in the learning process and
the amount of information that is given to students about
the problem. He ranked the methods according to their
ability to meet the following educational objectives: (1)
structuring of knowledge for use in clinical contexts, (2)
the development of an effective clinical reasoning process,
(3) the development of effective self-directed learning
skills, and (4) increased motivation for learning. Barrow's
ranking, in order of increasing effectiveness, and a brief
description of his categories are given below.</p>

<ul> <i><li>Case-based lectures</i>. Students receive
background information on a case to study prior to the
lecture. The cases are chosen to illustrate particular
diseases or conditions, and the instructor uses lectures to
guide the students through the diagnosis of the case. </li>

<i><li>Case method</i>. Students receive complete details
on a case, and study and research it themselves before
coming to class. The instructor, acting in a tutorial role,
facilitates class discussion of the analysis of the case.
</li>

<i><li>Modified case-based</i>. Students receive partial
details on a case and, after class discussion, choose from
a limited number of inquiry actions or decisions. The list
of inquiry actions and decisions may be generated by the
class or provided by the instructor. Students then receive
additional information on the case and further discussion
ensues. </li>

<i><li>Problem-based</i>. Students are presented with a
simulated patient. The students evaluate the patient's
signs and symptoms, generate hypotheses, and decide what
additional information is needed. The instructor
facilitates the class exploration of the problem. </li>

<i><li>Closed-loop problem-based</i>. After completing a
problem-based case, the students undertake self-directed
study. They then return to the problem as it was initially
presented and evaluate the information sources they used
and their prior reasoning and knowledge.</li></ul>

<p>10 Some of these methods are obviously not practical for
an isolated course, outside the context of an entirely-PBL
curriculum, because of the time needed for research related
to the cases and for self-directed learning. However, the
case-based lectures and case methods could be used even in
a traditional curriculum. <a href="#knapp">Knapp and Miller
(1987)</a>, <a href="#shannon">Shannon (1988)</a>, and <a href="#wolfe">Wolfe (1982)</a> discuss variations on the
use of those methods to teach biostatistics.</p>

<p>11 <a href="#barrows1">Barrows (1986)</a> stressed that
PBL methods do not include approaches that use problems
merely as an example of what has been learned, such as in
the <i>lecture-based cases method</i> that is already
widely used in teaching statistics (<a href="#boring">Boring and Nutter 1984</a>; <a href="#brogan">Brogan 1980</a>; <a href="#carter">Carter
1987</a>; <a href="#hacker">Hacker 1987</a>). In that
familiar method, the instructor lectures on a statistical
procedure and then tries to make the procedure relevant by
applying it to the analysis of an actual or artificial data
set. The background information given for these "cases" is
usually quite abbreviated; often no more than a sentence or
two containing the essential information needed to perform
the calculations. The students are motivated to some
extent, but they do not practice using the knowledge the
way they will have to use it in their research.</p>

<h1>3. A Case-Based Biostatistics Course</h1>

<h2>3.1 Reasons for Developing the Course </h2>

<p>12 In 1993, the College of Veterinary Medicine became the first veterinary school in the United States to adopt PBL in the preclinical phase of the professional (Doctor of Veterinary Medicine) curriculum, and the College is deeply committed to the success of the PBL curriculum. The College also offers a graduate program in Veterinary Medical Science (VMS) with a current enrollment of 12 MS and 13 PhD students. In contrast to the professional program, the graduate program is almost entirely subject-based and consists of traditional lectures and laboratories. Nearly all of the VMS students hold research assistantships that require 20 hours service per week in addition to the time spent in the laboratory on their thesis or dissertation research. </p>

<p>13 As the graduate program has grown, new program options have been added. Some of these program options require a course in epidemiological methods to meet accreditation standards. An epidemiology course is also needed for students desiring certification in particular disease specialties. I was asked to develop a new course, "Epidemiology/Biostatistics," that would fulfil those requirements.</p>

<p>14 VMS students are required to schedule one (MS students) or two (PhD students) statistics courses, unless they have taken the requisite number of statistics courses as part of another degree program. Most VMS students have no prior experience with statistics and schedule "Statistical Methods," a graduate-level service course offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. That department offers only one other graduate-level service course for non-majors, "Design and Analysis of Experiments." Although these two service courses cover numerous essential topics, many statistical methods important to biomedical research are not included. Some of those methods (e.g., linear regression analysis, nonparametric methods) are included in courses designed for statistics majors and require a mathematics background that most VMS students lack. Other topics (e.g., logistic regression, survival analysis, epidemiological methods) are not taught in any course. "Epidemiology/Biostatistics" was therefore designed to build upon the foundation laid by "Statistical Methods" by introducing statistical methods commonly used in biomedical research. It was also designed to be taught at a level suitable to the VMS students' mathematical training.</p>

<p>15 Another consideration in developing the new course
was my observation that students remember very little that
they are taught in traditional statistics courses. As the
only biostatistician in the College, my primary faculty
responsibilities are statistical consulting and
collaborative research. Whether assisting students with
analyses for their theses or dissertations or working as
part of a research team with fellow faculty members, I
continually encounter persons with a high level of
"statistics anxiety" who do not feel confident choosing an
appropriate analysis even in simple situations. All of
these people are products of traditional lecture-based
statistics courses. Because of PBL's emphasis on developing
reasoning and problem-solving skills, I decided to adopt a
PBL approach instead of a lecture approach for
"Epidemiology/Biostatistics."</p>

<h2>3.2 Choice of Cases </h2>

<p>16 The text currently used for "Statistical Methods" is
<cite>Statistical Methods</cite> by <a href="#freund">Freund and Wilson (1997)</a>; texts used in
the recent past include <cite>Statistics for
Research</cite> by <a href="#dowdy">Dowdy and Wearden
(1991)</a> and <cite>Principles and Procedures of
Statistics: A Biometrical Approach</cite> by <a href="#steel">Steel and Torrie (1980)</a>. The course
material is typical of introductory service courses and
comprises the basics of descriptive and inferential
statistics. Specific topics include the <i>t</i> test for
paired and independent samples and one-way ANOVA for
completely randomized and randomized complete block
designs. Depending on the instructor, Latin square and
split-plot designs and two-way ANOVA may be covered;
occasionally, a brief introduction to linear regression and
contingency table analysis is included. Although not all
VMS students take this particular course, it does represent
the general level of statistical preparation of students
enrolling in "Epidemiology/Biostatistics."</p>

<p>17 The cases for "Epidemiology/Biostatistics" were
selected to include statistical methods cited by <a href="#hammer">Hammer and Buffington (1994)</a> as those
most prevalent in the veterinary medical literature (<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). However, special emphasis was
placed on those methods that students were most likely to
misuse. In their study of 295 articles from ten leading
medical journals, <a href="#schor">Schor and Karten
(1966)</a> observed that only papers filled with
statistical tests and jargon were routinely subjected to a
statistical review. However, those papers typically used
statistics correctly because a statistician was involved as
co-author or as a collaborator on the project. A
statistician did not usually review papers that only used
"simple" statistical methods, such as <i>t</i> tests or
chi-square tests, and these methods were often used
incorrectly. Overall, statistical methods were used
correctly in only 52.5% of the articles. <a href="#shott">Shott (1985)</a> studied 635 articles
appearing in the <cite>Journal of the American Veterinary
Medical Association</cite> and the <cite>American Journal
of Veterinary Research</cite>. Only 466 of these papers
provided sufficient information to evaluate the statistics
used; statistical methods were used incorrectly in 54
(11.6%) of those papers. The most common error was treating
dependent observations as if they were independent; this
occurred in 47 (87.0%) of the papers with errors.</p>

<p>18 Based on this information, I chose to devote
approximately half of "Epidemiology/Biostatistics" to
studies involving two independent groups or two dependent
groups that would demonstrate the correct use of <i>t</i>
tests and chi-square tests. Currently, the course uses
eight cases that cover the topics listed in <a href="#appendix1">Appendix 1</a>. The first time I offered
this course, I used 13 cases. However, the semester is only
17 weeks long and that did not allow enough time to discuss
each case fully. The five cases that were eliminated dealt
with extensions of Cases 1-4 to more than two groups and
with multiple regression.</p>

<p>19 Whenever possible, I have based the cases on research
studies encountered in my statistical consulting practice.
In this way I can provide the original data as well as
insights into the investigator's reasons for conducting the
study and into design problems that needed to be overcome.
In some cases the principal investigator or other members
of the research team are still associated with the College
and available to participate in class discussion. The
original studies have usually been published as journal or
proceedings articles, which provide the scientific context
needed to make the problem important to the students.</p>

<p>20 Despite my varied consulting practice, I have also
needed to use other sources in developing cases.
Collections of case studies, such as <a href="#miller2">Miller, Efron, Brown, and Moses (eds.)
(1980)</a>, are a good source of original data accompanied
by detailed background information and references to
original studies. For example, I found two papers (<a href="#johnson">Johnson and Johnson 1972</a>; <a href="#vianna">Vianna, Greenwald, and Davies 1971</a>) cited in the
case study by <a href="#miller1">Miller (1980)</a> to be
useful for Cases 3 and 4. Those papers investigate the same
research question, but one study has independent groups and
the other has paired groups. The paper by <a href="#johnson">Johnson and Johnson (1972)</a> is
especially valuable for class discussion because it is an
example of an incorrect statistical analysis that appeared
in a major medical journal. Three subsequent "Letters to
the Editor" pointed out this error (<a href="#cole">Cole,
Mack, Rothman, Henderson, and Newell 1973</a>; <a href="#pike">Pike and Smith 1973</a>; <a href="#shimoka">Shimoka, Bross, and Tidings 1973</a>). <a href="#singer">Singer and Willett (1990)</a> compiled an
annotated bibliography of published data sets that could be
used as the basis for meaningful cases. Textbook examples
should be used only as a last resort because they generally
lack sufficient scientific context and background
information to motivate students to learn.</p>

<h2>3.3 Organization of the Course </h2>

<p>21 The present implementation of
"Epidemiology/Biostatistics" is a mixture of the
<i>case-based lectures method</i> and the <i>case
method</i>. Because the remainder of the curriculum
consists of traditional lectures and laboratories, the VMS
students cannot typically devote sufficient time outside of
class to research a case completely. Thus, the instructor
must decide when mini-lectures, either prepared or
extemporaneous, are needed to facilitate progress on a
given case. This lecture component, however, is intended to
be secondary to class discussion.</p>

<p>22 Prior to class discussion, each student receives
background information, such as a report or journal article
relevant to the current case. It is immaterial that the
students know from the beginning which statistical analyses
were used in the actual study; the focus of the case is on
learning how and why those analyses were chosen over other
possible alternatives. Each student also receives a
diskette containing the original data and a SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font> program that incorporates a
variety of analyses that are potentially relevant to the
research question and the experimental design. However, the
assumptions necessary for all of those analyses may not
hold; SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve; </font>code for
testing those assumptions is also included in the program.
Other resources include a biomedical statistics text (<a href="#woolson">Woolson 1987</a>) and supplementary
readings placed on reserve in the College branch library.
The instructor is freely available for consultation outside
of class. Students are instructed to read the background
information, run the SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font>
program, and bring the output to class.</p>

<p>23 During each class session, the instructor guides
discussion to help each student develop a cognitive
framework for evaluating alternative methods of analysis.
Initial discussion of a case involves understanding the
research question and the experimental design. Students are
led to recognize how the research question and the
experimental design influence the selection of statistical
methods. The advantages and disadvantages of alternative
procedures, assumptions underlying various statistical
methods, and ways of testing those assumptions are
considered. Students learn that the match between the
assumptions needed for a statistical analysis and the
actual experimental situation is never perfect, and that
the poorer the match, the more cautious they need to be
about their interpretation of the results of the analysis.
Follow-up analyses, especially the use of confidence
intervals to distinguish between statistical significance
and practical importance, and methods for summarizing
statistical results are explored. The use of hand
calculations and formulas is minimized; emphasis is placed
on using the SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font>
statistical package and interpreting SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font> output. Two weeks are usually
required to complete discussion of each case.</p>

<p>24 Students are evaluated following each case to assess
statistical knowledge and problem solving skills. Each
student prepares a detailed written report on the case,
which allows the instructor to uncover areas of confusion
and recommend additional individualized study. Then each
student chooses an analogous case in his/her area of
specialization that requires a similar design and analysis,
analyzes the data, and justifies the choice of analysis in
a written report. For the additional case, the student is
urged to use data from his/her own thesis or dissertation
research, from one of his/her major professor's research
projects, or from a journal article in his/her field that
gives the original data. When a student must rely on a
published article that does not provide the complete data,
he/she is shown how to use summary statistics to generate a
simulated data set using random number functions in
SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font>. Students may not
use data from textbook examples unless they obtain and read
the article that was the original source of the data. Each
student writes 16 reports during the semester; reports on
the cases discussed in class are considered homework and
the student-selected cases are treated as take-home
examinations. The final examination focuses on problem
solving in situations similar to those encountered in
class. Students receive background information and relevant
computer output on four research problems; access is
allowed to the class text and notes. Students are evaluated
on their ability to explain and justify the reasoning
process that led to their answers.</p>

<p>25 The short-term effectiveness of this program was
measured using a student evaluation questionnaire to
determine whether the course content and format met the
students' currently perceived needs. Questions concerning
operational aspects of the course were included to uncover
areas for improvement. Long-term effectiveness will be
assessed according to the students' success in applying
course concepts in their thesis or dissertation
research.</p>

<h1>4. An Example Case</h1>

<p>26 An example case compared the amount of injury caused
to coyote legs by two types of foothold traps (modified
Northwoods and modified Soft-Catch) used in north central
Mississippi during 1992 (<a href="#houben">Houben, Holland,
Jack, and Boyle 1993</a>). Ten coyotes were captured with
each type of trap and the trauma to the trapped leg was
rated according to severity on a scale devised by <a href="#olsen">Olsen, Linscombe, Wright, and Holmes
(1988)</a>. This scale assigns points to different injuries
ranging from bruises to amputations (<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>); the injury score is the
accumulated points for each type of unrelated injury. The
legs were scored jointly by a veterinary pathologist and a
veterinary radiologist. The study was designed by a
wildlife biologist; a biostatistician was not consulted
until after all the data had been collected.</p>

<p>27 Initial class discussion of this case concentrated on
determining the experimental design and the research
question. Design issues included the number of groups being
compared, whether the observations were paired or unpaired,
and possible sampling biases due to the geographical
distribution of the traps and the fact that the modified
Soft-Catch traps were set out earlier than the modified
Northwoods traps. Traps were set as part of normal
depredation control efforts and not distributed throughout
the study area according to any kind of randomization plan.
This raised concerns that the traps might not be capturing
animals from the same population. For example, one type of
trap might be more likely to capture older animals that
were more susceptible to injury. The wildlife biologist's
stated objective was to determine whether the two trap
designs differed in trap-related injuries. His original
plan for data analysis was simply to report the mean and
standard deviation of the injury score for each of the two
types of trap. However, the class felt that a test should
be performed to determine if the difference between the
means was statistically significant.</p>

<p>28 Discussion then centered on the question of whether
the mean was an appropriate summary statistic for the
injury score. The raw data and SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font> code for calculating the
injury scores are given in <a href="#appendix2">Appendix
2</a>; the frequency distribution for injury scores
resulting from the two types of traps is shown in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>. All of the legs sustained at
least a bruise or small cut and 90% of the scores on either
trap were 15 or lower. The distribution of injury scores
appears skewed because two legs suffered more serious
injuries. One leg captured in a modified Northwoods trap
received a bruise, a skin cut less than 2 cm, and a cut
ligament for a total injury score of 30. One leg captured
in a modified Soft-Catch trap received a bruise, a skin cut
greater than 2 cm, and a joint luxation for a total injury
score of 65. Some students in the class, who were also
veterinarians, were able to provide perspective on the
nature of these injuries and formed the opinion that the
leg with the 65 score was not injured more than twice as
badly as the leg with the 30 score. The class concluded
that injury score was measured on an ordinal scale because
the number of points assigned to each type of injury had
only an arbitrary relationship to the actual severity of
the injury. This led to consideration of the median as a
more appropriate measure of the "average" injury score.</p>

<p>29 Attention then turned to comparing the average injury
scores for the two trap types. From their previous
statistics classes, the students were familiar with the
<i>t</i> test for independent samples and the SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font> TTEST procedure. At this
point the instructor briefly reviewed the assumptions
necessary for the <i>t</i> test. Output from the TTEST
procedure was examined and the use of the F test for
equality of variances and the Satterthwaite and the Cochran
and Cox approximations were discussed. Students were shown
the relationship between the <i>t</i> test and one-way
ANOVA for a completely randomized design with two treatment
groups. They were also shown how to use the SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font> GLM procedure to output
residuals and to test the homogeneity of variances
assumption with Levene's test. The residuals were also
analyzed with the SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font>
UNIVARIATE procedure to test the normality assumption by
graphical means (box plot, stem-and-leaf plot, normal
probability plot) and the Shapiro-Wilk <i>W</i> statistic.
The GLM and UNIVARIATE procedures were also used to
demonstrate that a logarithmic transformation of the injury
scores did not make the variances more equal or the
distribution of the residuals more normal. Another
mini-lecture introduced the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test
(also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or the
Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test) as an alternative to the
<i>t</i> test for ordinal data. Students were shown how to
perform the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test with the SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font> NPAR1WAY procedure.</p>

<p>30 There was no statistically significant difference
between the two types of traps in mean or median injury
score by the <i>t</i> test (<i>p</i> = 0.81) or the
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (<i>p</i> = 0.27). The
discussion now focused on the practical importance of this
result. Students were shown how to calculate a point
estimate and a 95% confidence interval for the mean
difference using programming statements in the SAS<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font> DATA step and using the GLM
procedure, and for the median difference by manual
computation and using an Excel<font face="Symbol">&Ograve;</font> spreadsheet. The point
estimate and 95% confidence interval for the median
difference were 0 and [0, 5] points, thus the difference
was deemed to be of negligible practical importance.
Finally, the class considered alternative ways of
presenting the results in a publication (for example, in a
narrative manner, as point and interval estimates, and as
frequency distributions).</p>

<h1>5. Experiences with the Course</h1>

<h2>5.1 Evaluation </h2>

<p>31 "Epidemiology/Biostatistics" has been presented
twice, first to a class of 18 students and later to a class
of four students. In both classes, approximately half of
the students were enrolled in the VMS program and the
remainder consisted of graduate students in other
agricultural and life sciences disciplines. All of the
students had previously taken at least one introductory
statistics course. None of the students had prior
experience with PBL.</p>

<p>32 A formal evaluation questionnaire was administered to
the larger class. The responses indicated satisfaction with
both the case-based method and the course content. Of the
15 students completing the questionnaire, 10 agreed that
"The teaching methods used in this course are well chosen,"
and all agreed that "My instructor encourages student
participation and questions." All except one agreed with
the statement "The content of this course is relevant to my
needs." Specific student "likes" included "This teaching
style," "Learning to interpret SAS outputs," "Practical
application related to our own project," and "Open
discussion and relaxed lecture atmosphere." Students were
generally dissatisfied with the amount of time required to
prepare the reports. Although 80% agreed that "This course
was demanding compared to other graduate courses that I
have taken," 74% agreed that "The course was worth the
effort that I expended," and "I would recommend this course
to another student." A typical student comment was "My
overall understanding of statistics is greatly improved,
but the course took an enormous amount of time."</p>

<p>33 About half of the students later consulted with me
concerning the analysis of data from their thesis or
dissertation research. Most of those students displayed
less statistics anxiety than in consultations prior to the
course; however, that may be because they had become
accustomed to discussing statistical matters with me in
class. Nevertheless, those students were generally able to
develop a suitable analysis plan for their data and they
consulted with me merely for reassurance that their plan
was appropriate. In contrast, VMS students who have not had
my course are rarely able to devise a sound analysis plan
without extensive assistance.</p>

<p>34 Other evidence that "Epidemiology/Biostatistics"
promoted the students' capability for self-directed
learning came from two students in the second class. I
served as a committee member for their dissertation
research and they took their candidacy examinations at the
same time. For the statistics examination, I described a
generic bioassay experiment and told them that such
experiments are usually analyzed by probit analysis. I knew
that these two students did not have prior experience with
this technique and it had not been mentioned in
"Epidemiology/Biostatistics." The students were told to
teach themselves about probit analysis and write a short
paper describing probit analysis, discussing when and how
to use it. Next, they were told to find a set of data from
a bioassay experiment and analyze it by probit analysis,
either performed by hand or with a computer program, and to
write a report on the analysis. Finally, they were asked to
identify two techniques discussed in
"Epidemiology/Biostatistics" that could be used to estimate
the LD50 and to use those techniques to estimate the LD50.
Both students did exceptionally well on this examination
and were able to respond acceptably to questions posed
about probit analysis at their subsequent oral
examinations.</p>

<p>35 A rigorous comparison of the PBL approach to the
conventional lecture approach would require conducting
parallel courses using both methods to teach the same
material. However, this is impossible in my situation; I am
the only available instructor and the pool of potential
students is so limited that the course can only be taught
every two years. Providing more definitive proof that PBL
approach is effective for teaching biostatistics is left to
others in more favorable teaching circumstances.</p>

<h2>5.2 Difficulties</h2>

<p>36 Several obstacles were found in implementing the PBL
course described in this paper. A major difficulty was that
the students' other concurrent courses were traditional
lectures and laboratories. None of the students had enough
free time to assume complete responsibility for
investigating all the learning issues associated with each
case. Thus, lectures were needed to complement those
learning issues that the students developed in the group
discussions. In this type of course, the instructor's
constant challenge is providing essential supplementary
information without encouraging passive student learning
behavior.</p>

<p>37 In the larger class, several students hampered group
discussion by habitually failing to review the case
materials before coming to class. It was a formidable task
for the instructor to draw those students into the
discussion and prevent them from being passive note-takers.
This difficulty was greatly reduced in the subsequent,
smaller class. Because of the lower enrollment, each
student's contribution to the group discussion was more
obvious and subjected to greater scrutiny by the group.
That situation appeared to stimulate healthy competition in
proposing and defending problem-solving strategies.
However, the variety of approaches suggested was not as
great as in the larger class. Considering my experience
with both a large and a small class, a maximum class size
in the 6-10 range seems practical for this version of
PBL.</p>

<h2>5.3 Future Directions </h2>

<p>38 The number of cases was reduced from 13 to eight for
the second class in order to decrease the time commitment
for the writing component and to increase the time
available for class discussion. In the future, student
participation in case presentation will be increased in
order to reduce the lecture component further and to make
the class even more student-centered. Additional cases,
highlighting a broader range of veterinary medical research
situations, will be developed. Although not planned at this
time, cases could be offered as learning modules in either
a computer-assisted or primer format. That development
would allow students to review and practice problem-solving
skills in a self-paced environment and to explore, by
independent study, additional topics that are beyond the
scope of a one-semester course.</p>

<h1>6. Summary</h1>

<p>39 With both subject-based and PBL methods, the goal is
to impart the fundamental concepts of a discipline.
However, with subject-based teaching approaches, the
primary focus is on the concepts themselves and only
secondarily on the use of those concepts. With PBL methods,
the primary focus is on the process of using information to
solve problems. By associating concepts with solving
problems, knowledge is recalled more easily, retained
longer, and more readily applied to new problems.</p>

<p>40 By using statistics in real-life situations, PBL
methods help life sciences students develop a strategy for
dealing with problems, give them a mental framework for
evaluating alternative methods of analysis, and motivate
them to take responsibility for their own learning. They
also stimulate students to learn more about statistics and
discourage the attitude that everything important about
statistics can be learned in one or two semesters.</p>

<p>41 A PBL method was used by the author to give
veterinary medical science graduate students direct
practice in the statistical reasoning skills needed to
choose appropriate procedures for analyzing data from their
own research studies and to evaluate the research of
others. In this case-based approach, actual biomedical
research studies were used to explore alternative designs
and methods, follow-up analyses, and methods for
summarizing statistical results. Concepts were practiced
and reinforced through written reports. Student evaluations
indicated satisfaction with this approach. This course is
continually being revised to encourage greater student
involvement and better to promote self-directed
learning.</p>
