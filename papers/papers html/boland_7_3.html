<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>In the lottery game Lotto <i>n</i>/<i>N</i>, the
winning <i>n</i> numbers are selected randomly and without
replacement from <nobr>{1, 2, 3, ..., <i>N</i>}.</nobr> The
selection of the winning numbers is normally done with a
highly sophisticated mechanical device, and one of the
appealing aspects of Lotto is that this procedure is seen
to be fair and unbiased. An important perceived consequence
is that no one (for a given amount of money) is seen to
have a better chance of winning than anyone else. Few
people would be willing to let an individual perform this
task because of possible bias, but do we really know how
difficult it is for an individual to be random in selecting
numbers?  In an experiment to observe the types and degrees
of bias an individual might possess, data were collected
from students who were asked to perform as 'random' number
generators for the Lotto 6/42 game. Data consisting of the
winning numbers from the Irish National Lottery game Lotto
6/42 were obtained from previous years, and a statistical
package (in this case, S-Plus) was used to generate other
simulated data.  A comparison of the three sets of data
using many of the basic tools in descriptive statistics
together with some goodness of fit tests provides a useful
exercise for students to test their intuition about
randomness and to discover some of the inherent (and
sometimes subtle) biases individuals possess when they
attempt to be random.</p>

<h1>1. Introduction:  Selecting 'Random' <i>n</i>-tuples
in Lotto <i>n</i>/<i>N</i> </h1>

<p>1 In the lottery game Lotto <i>n</i>/<i>N</i>, the
<i>n</i> &quot;winning&quot; numbers are selected without replacement
in a random manner (usually through the use of a carefully
manufactured mechanical device) from the numbers {1, 2, 3,
..., <i>N</i>}. Lotto 6/49 is a popular version, but many
other combinations of <i>n</i>/<i>N</i> are used in various
states in the USA and countries throughout the world.
Although there are many publications (including many
magazines) that summarise recent information about winning
and/or popular numbers, the entertaining booklet <cite>Dr.
Z's 6/49 Lotto Guidebook</cite> (<a href="#ziemba">Ziemba 1986</a>) is a
well-written introduction to Lotto and provides the layman
with answers to many (the 49 most frequently asked?)
questions about the Lotto 6/49 game.</p>

<p>2 Of course, one of the major attractions of the Lotto
<i>n</i>/<i>N</i> game is that because the winning numbers
are 'randomly' selected, each of the
<img width="31" height="41" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064148im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n3/boland.img3.gif" alt="$N\choose n$"> 
possible winning <i>n</i>-tuples is equally likely to be
chosen.  Unlike the situation in many other forms of
gambling (such as horse-racing or football pools), the
average gambler has the same chance of winning on the basis
of one <i>n</i>-tuple as any so-called 'expert.'  One piece
of advice that can be given to players (in order to avoid
sharing the jackpot with <b>many</b> others in the unlikely
event that it is won) is to avoid popular combinations. 
Students are well able to understand the rationale for this
advice, although it is perhaps a different matter to know what, in fact, are  the  popular combinations.  It is
somewhat surprising to note (see, for example, <a href="#henze97">Henze 1997</a> or
<a href="#kadell">Kadell and Muisaker 1991</a>) that recent previous winning
combinations are very popular in many Lotto games, as well
as arithmetic or geometric progressions and sometimes
combinations related to the shape or design of the ticket
(for example, diagonals).  <a href="#kadell">Kadell and Muisaker (1991)</a>
evaluate the performance of three types of players --
&quot;foolish,&quot; &quot;sensible,&quot; and &quot;intelligent.&quot; &quot;Foolish&quot; players
are those who select obviously popular combinations,
&quot;sensible&quot; players are those who use random devices to
select their combinations (say, by using a &quot;Quick Pick&quot; or
&quot;Easy Pick&quot; facility), while &quot;intelligent&quot; players are
those who try to avoid all other manually (as opposed to
randomly) selected plays.  Experience (in which one obtains
local information on popular combinations) is a key factor
in becoming an &quot;intelligent&quot; player.</p>

<p>3 In any case, it seems clear that when individuals
manually make selections in Lotto, they tend to
select (typically low) numbers related to birthdays, ages,
favorite dates, car registration numbers, etc., and hence
the numbers are clearly <b>not</b> randomly selected. An
interesting experiment for students is to challenge them to
attempt to act as truly 'random' generators for a Lotto
game. A comparison of the results of a group of students
with the actual winning combinations from a local Lotto
game (as well as some data simulated from a statistical
package like S-Plus or Minitab) can, with the use of basic
graphs and descriptive statistics,  lead to interesting
insights into hidden (and sometimes subtle) biases that
individuals possess, even when they attempt to be
random.</p>

<p>4 For our experiment, data were obtained in three ways.
Initially we collected data from 234 university students
studying statistics  in our basic first year introductory
course.  After discussing random number generation and the
Irish National Lottery game Lotto 6/42, we asked each
student to attempt to act (once) as a random generator  for
the game by randomly selecting, in any order, six numbers
from {1, 2, 3, ..., 42}. In our large classroom setting,
students were asked to provide their selections on a sheet
of paper after viewing the following overhead projector
slide: </p>


<p>
<div align="CENTER">
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tr><th align="CENTER"><p><br>In the Irish National Lottery Game<br>
LOTTO 6/42<br>
the winning 6 numbers are selected<br>
by a random mechanism.</p>
<p>Please generate for me (in any order) a random<br>
selection of 6 numbers from 
{1, 2, 3, ..., 42} and<br>
write them down on the piece of paper provided.</p>
</th>
</tr>
</table> 
</div> 


<p>5 This provided us with our <b>Individual</b> dataset of
234 six-tuples.  The Irish National Lottery provided us
with our second dataset (<b>Lotto 6/42</b>) which consisted
of the 264 winning selections in the Lotto 6/42 game from
24 September 1994 (when the Irish Lotto game changed from
Lotto 6/39 to Lotto 6/42) until 8 March 1997. A third
dataset (<b>S-Plus Simulation</b>) consisting of 264 (to
match the size of the dataset provided by the Irish
National Lottery) six-tuples of numbers selected without
replacement from  {1, 2, 3, ..., 42} was generated using
S-Plus.  The objective of the experiment was to compare the
three datasets of multivariate (six-tuple) observations in
order to make inferences about the ability of individuals
to act as true 'random' generators for Lotto 6/42.  The
three datasets are contained in the file <a href="/web/20130307064148/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/datasets/lotto.dat.txt">lotto.dat.txt</a>;
the file <a href="/web/20130307064148/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/datasets/lotto.txt">lotto.txt</a>
is a documentation file containing a brief description of
the datasets.</p>

<p>6 Various graphs and plots like those given in this
article (which were generated using S-Plus) can be used in
a classroom setting to generate interesting discussions
about randomness and bias.  Our introductory statistics
course is quite extensive (consisting of 96 classes or
lectures on statistics over 24 weeks, plus weekly computer
practicals and several exams), and so during
the year a lot of material is covered (but with very little
mathematical derivation). Because of the size of the class
and nature of the classroom (a large lecture theatre), the
material was presented to the class in the form of overhead
projection transparencies at relevant points during the
course. In our case, the simulated data were generated by
the teacher outside of class, although perhaps in smaller
classes (where computer facilities permit or where a
project is to be done) students might simulate their own
data. </p>

<p>7 <a href="#Figure1">Figures 1</a> and <a href="#Figure2">2</a> are presented relatively early in our
course when discussing descriptive statistics (although the
subtle aspect of the nonoverlapping notches in the boxplots
of <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a> needs to be revisited at a later stage), while
<a href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a> comes when discussing the topic of the sampling
distribution of the sample mean.  The practical importance
of the Central Limit Theorem is emphasized in our course,
and although in this experiment <img width="15" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="/web/20130307064148im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n3/boland.img5.gif" alt="$\bar{x}$">
is based on a rather small sample (of size six) taken
without replacement from a finite population, it does
provide an interesting example where <img width="15" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="/web/20130307064148im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n3/boland.img5.gif" alt="$\bar{x}$"> is approximately normal. This is well
illustrated by <a href="#Figure3">Figures 3</a> and <a href="#Figure4">4</a> (for the randomly generated
samples).  We also  emphasize plots in our course
(particularly normal probability plots), and <a href="#Figure4">Figures 4</a> and
<a href="#Figure5">5</a> are used when comparing the spread of distributions to
the normal. Although a good understanding of the
distribution of the minimum gap is perhaps beyond most
students, they do seem to understand (with the help of
<a href="#Figure6">Figure 6</a>) the point that individuals seem to avoid
selecting consecutive numbers.  <img width="23" height="37" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064148im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n3/boland.img1.gif" alt="$\chi^2$">
goodness of fit tests come rather late in our course
(although in fact students do not encounter much difficulty
with them), and it is at this point that the material in 
<a href="#Table1">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#Table2">2</a> 
is presented.</p>

<p>8 We also teach a large introductory course in statistics
to first year psychology students, and although there is no
lab component to their course, they often benefit from
general discussions based on <a href="#Figure1">Figures 1</a> through <a href="#Figure3">3</a>. We find
that students are not usually surprised to observe the
similar characteristics of the second and third datasets
(the actual winning Lotto 6/42 combinations and the S-Plus
computer-simulated data), but they are usually intrigued to
observe how different in many respects the
<b>Individual</b> dataset is from the other two.</p>

<p>

<h1>2. Order and Frequencies of Numbers in Selections </h1>

<p>9 Individuals were asked to generate (and write down)
their selections in any order. The intention was that this
be interpreted to mean the order itself should be random
(and we felt this was the implication), although one might
interpret this as meaning &quot;in any order you choose.&quot;  It is
important that instructions to students not be ambiguous in
this respect.  In any case, it is clear that our
<b>Individual</b>  data show the tendency of people to
generate numbers in <b>increasing</b> order.  This is
demonstrated nicely by the use of three sets of
simultaneous 'notched' box plots in 
<nobr><a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a>.</nobr>  For the
<b>Individual</b> data, we have notched box plots for the
six selections in the order they were generated (written
down), and similarly for the <b>Lotto 6/42</b> and
<b>S-Plus Simulation</b> sets.  Non-overlapping notches
from two such box plots indicate a significant difference
in means at approximately the 5% level.  Hence, the first,
second, third, and fourth selections for the
<b>Individual</b> data display a significant increasing
trend. However, the only significant difference when
considering the other two  datasets is between the second
and sixth selections in the S-Plus simulated data. Here we
have an opportunity to show students how careful one must
be in making multiple comparisons.  In looking for
significant differences among ordered selections in any one
of the three sets of data, we are actually making

= 15 comparisons.
Hence, if the order in a selection is truly random (as it
should be in each of the datasets <b>Lotto
6/42</b> and <b>S-PLUS Simulation</b>), we would expect
about

<p>10 In collecting the <b>Individual</b> data, students
were, of course, asked to <b>'randomly'</b> generate
numbers, in contrast to picking their favorite or lucky
numbers. Truly random methods of generating six-tuples
should, of course, yield uniform marginal distributions.  
In <i>m</i> truly random selections of <i>n</i>-tuples for

times (and hence for Lotto 6/42 approximately

also use histograms with percentages instead of absolute
frequencies, and for Lotto 6/42 one would expect each

<p>11 Note that in spite of the request for individuals to
chose 'randomly,' the histogram for the <b>Individual</b>
data clearly shows a slight tendency for individuals to
pick <b>smaller</b> numbers. If one considers, for example,
the lower and upper halves of the possible numbers [1-21]
and [22-42], respectively, then 15 of the first half were
selected more often than would be expected, while only two
of the second half (27 and 41) were likewise selected. In
contrast to this, the histograms for the <b>Lotto 6/42</b>
and <b>S-Plus Simulation</b> datasets seem to display no
unusual features of this nature. Although students do not
find these observations very surprising, results like these
can lead to interesting discussions as to why smaller
numbers in general (and some specific ones in particular)
might be favored.  Before showing students histograms of
this type it might be useful to ascertain what they think
they will look like!</p>

<p>12 It is natural to ask if there is any 'significance' in
these histograms, and, in particular, whether the selected numbers are uniformly distributed on {1, 2, 3, ..., 42}.
One naturally thinks of using a

that the selections are samples of size <i>n</i> taken

Lotto 6/42), we would expect <img width="15" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="/web/20130307064148im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n3/boland.img5.gif" alt="$\bar{x}$">
to be approximately normally distributed, and in particular that

for each of our three datasets.  Although the histogram
for  the means from the <b>Individual</b> data is slightly
skewed to the left with a few very small values, the three
histograms are roughly normal in shape (note that means for
the <b>Individual</b> data seem to be centered slightly to
the left of 21.5).  Students should, however, be aware of the
impact of interval width on the shape of a histogram, and
that QQ plots (and, in this case, normal quantile plots) are
more robust and usually more informative in comparing
distributions.  These datasets offer a good opportunity to
demonstrate this to students.</p>

shape to a normal distribution (due to the linearity of the
vast bulk of observations) but which is centered to the
left of 21.5 and which has slightly heavier tails
(particularly the left) than a normal distribution.  There
are a few &quot;individual&quot; selections that should clearly be
termed &quot;outliers.&quot; Five people selected the numbers

individual selected <nobr>(42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37).</nobr>

trying to be random! These &quot;outliers,&quot; however, do not have a

are multivariate, and we might naturally ask about what type
of spread one would expect in a selection that is randomly
generated.  The sample variance <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> of a
selection is a natural measure of spread to consider. In
general for Lotto <i>n</i>/<i>N</i>, one may easily verify
that  <nobr><i>E</i>(<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>) =
<i>N</i>(<i>N</i> + 1)/12,</nobr> which for Lotto 6/42
gives  <i>E</i>(<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>) = 150.5.  In <a href="#Figure5">Figure 5</a>,
we see a QQ plot of the sample variances from the
<b>Individual</b> selections, in comparison with those from
<b>Lotto 6/42</b>.  The distribution of
<i>s</i><sup>2</sup> from the <b>Individual</b> selections
compares reasonably well with that from Lotto 6/42, except
in the tails (particularly the left tail).  The
<b>Individual</b> selections seem to be more skewed to the
left (in this case because a small number of people made
very concentrated selections which resulted in very small
values of <i>s</i><sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p>18 There are, of course, many possible measures of
variability or spread in a selection, and another somewhat
natural one is what we will call the minimum gap (MG).  We
define the random variable MG as follows:</p>

reordered in increasing order.  Note that <i>MG</i> = 1 if
and only if the selection contains two consecutive
numbers.  It is reasonably straightforward to derive the
distribution of MG for random selections of <i>n</i>
numbers from {1, 2, ..., <i>N</i>} and to show that</p>

<p>19 For Lotto 6/42,  <i>P</i>(<i>MG</i> = 1)
= 0.56 is the probability of a selection containing two
consecutive numbers.  Students usually find it very
surprising and nonintuitive that it is more
likely than not that a random selection will contain two
consecutive numbers. Before giving students the
probability of two consecutive numbers appearing in Lotto,
it is a worthwhile exercise to test their intuition by
asking them for estimates of it!  In <a href="#Figure6">Figure 6</a>, 
we have relative frequency polygons for the minimum gap MG for our
three datasets.  We see that <b>Individuals</b> have a
clear tendency to spread out their selections more than one
would expect from truly random selections, and in
particular, the observed number of minimum gaps equal to one
is unexpectedly low.</p>

<h1>5. Conclusions </h1> 

<p>21 The whole concept of randomness is a delicate one, and
one about which considerable research has been done,
particularly in the field of psychology.  <a href="#reichenbach">Reichenbach (1949)</a> claimed that
humans are unable to produce a random sequence of
responses, even when explicitly asked to  do so, and
considerable research  since then (including our work)
generally supports this.  Many teachers/lecturers have told
us of classroom activities they use to get students
thinking about randomness, and  <a href="#green">Green
(1997)</a> gives an interesting account of an experiment on
recognizing randomness. </p> 

<p>22 How well can individuals perform when they attempt to
be  random generators for a game like Lotto? Some
interesting  insights into human  intuition about
randomness may be obtained by asking a class of students to
participate in an  exercise that tries to answer this
question. We asked each of the  students in a large class
to act once as a random generator for the winning numbers 
in our Irish National Lottery - Lotto 6/42 game. The
results were then analysed and compared with actual recent
winning selections in our Lotto game, as well as with
another set simulated by computer. Using boxplots,
histograms, QQ-plots, and some  basic measures of spread in
a sample, one is able to generate interesting  classroom
discussions about biases that individuals seem to possess.
We observed (perhaps not surprisingly) that there seems to
be a propensity for individuals  to select numbers in
increasing order. We also observed that individuals tend to
select numbers which on the average are smaller (by at
least two) than would be expected from a truly random
generator. Of course, in other countries or states where a
different  form of Lotto is played, the results will
probably differ. When it comes to the spread in a
selection, we observed that individuals tend to make
selections that are reasonably spread out as measured by
sample variance, but not in other ways (for example, as
measured by the so-called minimum gap in a selection).  In
particular, we observed a clear reluctance of individuals 
(compared to a truly random generator) to make selections
containing consecutive numbers. </p>
