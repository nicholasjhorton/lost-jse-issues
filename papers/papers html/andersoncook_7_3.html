<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This article discusses an active learning technique that
can be easily incorporated into a variety of introductory
statistics classes to demonstrate purely subjective and
statistical confidence intervals. The concepts of
confidence intervals, confidence levels, and the fixed, but
unknown, population parameter are frequently misunderstood
by a significant proportion of students. This class
activity demonstrates these concepts by stressing the
objective nature of statistical confidence intervals. It
also emphasizes that the precision of the interval depends
on the quality of the data used in its construction. The
proposed exercise takes less than 50 minutes of lecture
time and helps to solidify these essential statistical
concepts in a visual and memorable way. Student reaction to
the exercise has been positive as measured anecdotally  by
both improved student understanding of the concepts and
increased interest in the activity. </p>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>1 This exercise is currently used in introductory
statistics courses for non-statistics majors in a variety
of different disciplines, including engineering,
mathematics, and the biological, physical, and social
sciences. The goal of the exercise is to present visually
the concept of the confidence level and the fixed, but
unknown, nature of the parameter being estimated. The
activity emphasizes the objective nature of the confidence
interval and how the precision of the interval depends on
the quality of information obtained through appropriate
sampling strategies. </p>

<p>2 A key feature of the exercise is that the students are
actively engaged in the demonstration of the concepts,
which is essential for increasing student learning (<a href="#angelo">Angelo 1993</a>). This interaction with
students and their involvement in all phases of the
activity help to solidify difficult statistical
concepts.</p>

<p>3 The activity consists of three phases. In Phase 1, the
students naively give a purely subjective &quot;95%
confidence interval&quot; for a fact about which they have
some intuition, but likely no precise knowledge. A plot of
their intervals is shown, and some discussion follows about
what the &quot;95%&quot; measures. In Phase 2, students
employ the same purely subjective interval construction
method for a different fact, but now they should have a
better understanding of the conditions the intervals are
expected to satisfy. In both phases, students tend to make
their intervals too narrow, and hence, the intervals do not
include the true parameter with appropriate frequency.
Phase 3 makes the transition from a purely subjective
interval to a statistical confidence interval. In Phase 3,
students examine the similarities and differences between
the two types of intervals. Phase 3 concludes with a
demonstration of constructing confidence intervals for the
mean of a normal population using simple random samples. 
This phase can also include a discussion of distributional
assumptions and sample size requirements for the use of
statistical confidence intervals.</p>

<p>4 The exercise requires less than a single lecture (I
typically take approximately 40 minutes to run through all
of the demonstrations and discussion), and requires active
participation from the students. The ideal class size for
the activity is around 40, but it will work for classes of
size 20 to 100. If the class is too small, it may be
difficult to illustrate the 95% confidence level
effectively. If the class is much larger than 40, only a
subset of students should be used at each of Phases 1 and
2.</p>

<p>5 Materials required include a fact sheet (<a href="#Table1">Table 1</a>), two or three file cards or
small pre-cut pieces of paper for each student in the
class, and an overhead projector with several gridded
transparencies (a transparency made from a photocopied
piece of graph paper works well). Alternately, the
transparencies can be replaced with a projection screen and
laptop computer, if the S-Plus functions in <a href="#Appendix1">Appendix 1</a> are incorporated into the
demonstration. This second approach allows for slightly
faster presentation of the data, but both methods work
well.</p>

<h1>2. Details of the Activity</h1>

<p>6 Typically, this activity is run early in the unit on
estimation, but after students have had some introduction
to probability and the normal distribution. It is helpful
if there has been some discussion about how poll results
are usually reported with a margin of error and a confidence
level (e.g., 12% ± 2%, correct 19 times out of
20).</p>

<h2>2.1 Phase 1</h2>

<p>7 In Phase 1, students are asked to provide purely
subjective 95% confidence intervals for a given fact
(selected from the fact sheet shown in <a href="#Table1">Table 1</a>). In addition to the facts given
in Table 1, some local or state facts may also be of
interest. These are readily available from almanacs or the
Internet. Generally, few instructions are given to clarify
what is meant by a 95% confidence interval; instead, the
students are left to make their own judgments. It is
helpful to give the students some scale for their estimates
(e.g., &quot;In thousands, give a 95% confidence interval
for...).</p>

<p>8 The intervals are recorded on the file cards, collected,
and summarized by a student assistant (usually a volunteer
from the class). While the helper is entering the data onto
the gridded overhead, it is possible to discuss what the
students were thinking about when they determined the width
of their intervals (i.e., their notions of &quot;95%
confident&quot;). It is also helpful to discuss what would
constitute the ideal interval (namely one that is narrow,
but also correct). If transparencies are used, it is
helpful to determine an upper and lower bound that includes
the intervals of all of the students in the class before
the cards are collected. Once all of the intervals are
recorded on the overhead, a vertical line is added to show
the true value of the fact under consideration. Alternately
this can be done using the function &quot;conf.int&quot;
given in <a href="#Appendix1">Appendix 1</a>.  <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a> shows an example of what the
result might look like for 20 students after completion of
Phase 1.</p>

<p>9 Typically, far more than the expected 5% of students'
intervals will fail to include the true value in their
range. In the example given, only 11 of 20 students gave
intervals that included the true parameter value. This can
lead to discussion about what this would mean in practice,
if we quoted a 95% C.I., but the actual true confidence
level was much lower.</p>

<h2>2.2 Phase 2</h2>

<p>10 In Phase 2, repeat the activity in Phase 1 with a slight modification. Ask each student to give a 95% confidence interval and to provide a single best guess for a new fact. Record the intervals and point estimates. The goal of this phase is to help students formalize some of the concepts in &quot;common sense&quot; terms, before changing to the statistical realm, where many students seem less willing to trust their intuition.</p>

<p>11 Discussion of the Phase 2 intervals provides an opportunity to highlight specific results of the constructed intervals and general properties of confidence intervals. After calculating the proportion of intervals containing the true value, students can assess the accuracy of the group of confidence intervals. Quite often the majority of students will still make their intervals too narrow to cover the true value, so you may not be close to the desired 95% confidence level. Students can also be encouraged to consider how the results and desirability of the intervals would change if the desired confidence level changed to 90% or 99%. For example, the 90% confidence level allows for a narrower interval, since there is less of a burden to be correct than for the 95% or 99% confidence intervals. Examination of the point estimates can motivate discussion of the advantages of having a quantifiable success rate for the intervals, versus the simplicity of a single value for the point estimate. Finally, the merits of having the point estimate centered in the interval can be discussed.</p>

<h2>2.3 Phase 3</h2>

<p>12 Phase 3 involves making the transition from purely
subjective intervals to statistical confidence intervals.
First, some remarks should be made about common features of
all interval estimates. The motivation for creating an
interval is to provide a reasonable range of values that
has a high likelihood of including the true parameter of
interest. The ideal interval will be narrow and accurate
(contain the true value). It should be clear to the
students that increasing the amount of knowledge used to
construct the interval should lead to a narrower, more
precise interval. Again, it is helpful to highlight the
lack of quantification about whether point estimates are
&quot;close&quot; to the true value, and how confidence intervals
overcome this weakness. It should be emphasized that the
confidence level is based on repeated sampling (such as the
construction of many intervals by members of the class),
but for a given case, we usually have only a single
interval under consideration. The single confidence
interval is either correct or incorrect (all or nothing),
but the confidence level gives us an indication of the
proportion of correct intervals that can be expected with
repeating the estimation procedure.  Finally, once an
interval is constructed, we usually do not find out if it
is actually correct. This final point is worth stressing,
since it helps the students focus on the difference between
the sample, where all the data are available, and the
population, where the true answer is typically unknown.</p>

<p>13 Next, some time is spent formalizing the connection
between purely subjective intervals and statistical
confidence intervals and highlighting key differences
between the two methods. A sample from the population is
similar to partial knowledge used to estimate the quantity
of interest. In both the purely subjective and the
statistical cases, we have some information that helps us
give a range of sensible values, but the lack of complete
knowledge leads to some uncertainty in the estimates. We
hope that our knowledge will allow us to make a sensible
estimate, but we are unsure of its accuracy. The amount of
knowledge used to estimate the purely subjective interval
is roughly analogous to the amount of data collected for a
statistical confidence interval. As more data or
information becomes available, the interval will become
narrower. For a purely subjective interval, information is
measured by the level of knowledge
about the subject matter. For a statistical confidence
interval, the width depends on the number of observations
in the sample from the population of interest.</p>

<p>14 The quality of information used to construct the
intervals and the accuracy of the intervals can also be
compared. If someone with no accurate knowledge of the
subject matter suggests a purely subjective confidence
interval, we would not expect his or her interval to be
helpful for estimating the true quantity of interest.
Similarly, if a sample is not representative of the
underlying population it is thought to describe, we should
not expect the interval to provide an accurate estimate of
the population value.</p>

<p>15 The estimation of intervals by multiple students is
roughly analogous to collecting multiple samples.  Each
student or sample produces an interval, but typically in
practice, only a single interval is formed, and we do not
know if the interval is correct. A key difference between
methods is that given the same amount of knowledge (e.g.,
two students who took the same course in geography), two
purely subjective intervals are unlikely to be the same,
but given the same data, a single statistical confidence
interval is obtained. This lack of subjectivity for the
statistical method is a significant advantage. </p>

<p>16 Another difference between the methods is that unless we are able to determine the true value of the parameter of interest, we cannot quantify the confidence level of a purely subjective interval. However, for a statistical confidence interval, there is underlying theory that (under certain distributional assumptions) gives us an accurate confidence level for our intervals.</p>

<p>17 To conclude this phase of the exercise, two options
are available. Print the figures in <a href="#Appendix2">Appendix 2</a> onto transparencies or use
the S-Plus functions in <a href="#Appendix1">Appendix 1</a>
to display results for statistical confidence intervals.
The S-Plus function called &quot;norm.conf&quot; generates
a large number of samples from a given normal distribution,
and calculates the confidence interval for the mean for
each sample. An example of the output from the function is
given in <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a> for 40 samples of
size 10 drawn from a normal distribution with mean 42 and
standard deviation 4 units. Alternately, you can use Figure
2, along with Figures <a href="#Figure3">3</a> and <a href="#Figure4">4</a> in <a href="#Appendix2">Appendix
2</a>, to show a variety of results. These plots each show
40 intervals generated using different sample sizes and
confidence levels.</p>

<p>18 These figures can be used to discuss several key
features of statistical confidence intervals. We can assess
the true confidence level of the confidence intervals by
looking at the proportion of  intervals that contain the
true population parameter. In the example given in <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>, 39 of the 40 confidence
intervals contain the true parameter value. This is
consistent with data from a binomial distribution with
probability of success equal to 0.95.  Differences in
observed interval widths for a fixed sample size are a
reflection of the quality of the data that we observe in
each sample. Increasing the sample size results in narrower
confidence intervals, as can be seen in Figures <a href="#Figure2">2</a> and <a href="#Figure3">3</a>.
Decreasing the confidence level reduces the width of the
confidence intervals, as shown by Figures <a href="#Figure2">2</a> and <a href="#Figure4">4</a>. 
Finally, a discussion can be included of how violations of
distributional assumptions can lead to incorrect confidence
levels. At the end of this exercise, students have the
conceptual background and the motivation to learn 
details about the construction of statistical confidence
intervals for the mean of a normal distribution. </p>



<h1>3. Conclusions</h1>

<p>19 This simple exercise has been implemented successfully
into several introductory statistics courses. Students
appreciate the visual demonstration of concepts that have
frequently been a source of confusion, and they are better
able to discuss the meaning of statistical confidence
intervals, confidence levels, and the advantages of
interval estimation over point estimation. Feedback from
the students about the activity has been positive. At the
conclusion of the course, many still remember the exercise
and comment on it positively. On term tests and the final
exam, questions about confidence intervals seem to be
answered correctly more consistently than in the past, and
students are better able to verbalize these concepts.
Relatively few specialized resources and only a small
amount of time are required to effectively introduce this
important concept and build increased statistical
literacy.</p>
