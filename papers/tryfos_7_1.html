<h2>                          Abstract</h2>

<p>    The aim of this paper is to draw to the attention
    of statisticians teaching business students three
    substantial computer simulations, the single
    objective of which is profit maximization.  It is
    believed that in pursuing this purely business
    objective, students gain a better understanding of
    the need for and utility of statistical methods for
    research, analysis, and forecasting.  The full text
    of these simulations and the associated computer
    programs, teaching notes, and sample student
    responses may be freely downloaded and used for
    classroom purposes.</p>



<h1>                      1.  Background</h1>


<p>1    Among the many fields of study where statistical methods
     find applications is business, and business students
     constitute a large proportion of those receiving instruction
     in statistical methods.  Some believe that this audience
     tends to be a reluctant one, captured as it were in
     compulsory business statistics courses, and likely to be
     considerably smaller if these courses were to become
     optional.  Business students often protest that the
     traditional business statistics course, with its emphasis on
     probability theory, special distributions, sampling with
     replacement from normal populations, tests of hypotheses,
     confidence intervals, and the classical linear model, does
     not appear to address any recognizable important business
     problems.

<p>2    One reason for this perception may be that the course does
     not seem to speak the universal language of business --
     profit.  To business students and practitioners alike,
     profit (interpreted broadly as the difference between
     revenue and cost, between reward and effort in the long
     term) is the driving force and profit maximization the
     almost universal business objective.  How, one hears being
     asked, does statistics help pursue this objective?  Of what
     utility is knowing how to perform, say, a test of equality
     of means of two normal populations at the five percent level
     based on a sample with replacement?

<p>3    Such questions were indeed raised from several quarters in
     recent debates that led to a major revision of the MBA
     program at York University, one of the victims of which was
     the traditional business statistics course.  The debates
     centered on the extent of the compulsory part of the program
     in general, and its allocation among competing fields.  Some
     faculty members were not averse to a program in which
     statistics had no share at all of the compulsory curriculum.
     In the end, a shorter and broader course providing an
     introduction to quantitative methods replaced the business
     statistics course.  Supporters of this course reasoned that
     quantitative methods are useful for research, analysis,
     forecasting, and optimization.  By "research," they pointed
     out, one should understand the gathering of information by
     means of samples, surveys, and experiments.  By "analysis,"
     the detection of trends, patterns, and relationships.  And
     by "forecasting," the projection, extension or extrapolation
     of these trends, patterns, and relationships into new cases
     or times.  These are objectives for which statistical
     methods are designed.  Supporters recognized, however, that
     no problem formulation in business is complete without a
     fourth dimension -- optimization, formally the province of
     management science or operations research, by which is
     understood the selection of the best of the available
     alternatives.  Hardly any business problem exists,
     supporters argued, that does not involve to some extent
     research, analysis, forecasting, and optimization; not all
     these problems, of course, are amenable to quantitative
     methods, but enough important ones exist to justify a
     required course.

<p>4    It appeared highly desirable for the replacement course to
     find cases illustrating business applications of methods for
     research, analysis, forecasting, and optimization,
     especially profit maximization.  Although cases could be
     found involving research or analysis or forecasting or
     optimization, good cases touching all four dimensions in a
     unified whole were not readily available.

<p>5    It appeared possible, however, to select elements from
     individual cases and weave them into an integrated problem
     having real components but not being real itself as a whole.
     For example, features could be drawn from one case having to
     do with sampling and from another related to analysis and
     forecasting to describe a fictional situation involving all
     three dimensions.  Even so, a case, like any exercise or
     problem, is static:  it describes, say, what was discovered
     after taking a sample of a given size by a particular
     method, what model was formulated based on this information,
     and what decisions were taken in the light of forecasts from
     this model; it does not lend itself to investigating what
     may have happened if different decisions were made in the
     light of different forecasts from a different model that
     appeared best in the light of different information based on
     a sample of a different size obtained by a different method.
     In addition, a case does not lend itself to variations;
     strict adherence to the original reduces its usefulness as
     an educational tool over time as its lessons become known to
     and are copied by an increasing number of students.

<p>6    The last two shortcomings of a case are the advantages of a
     simulation, in which a situation is created by a computer
     program in a manner that depends on the student's choices.
     For example, a population can be described by computer
     statements, and a simple, stratified, or other sample of a
     given size created on request; or, a process generating a
     time series can be similarly described and a series of
     suitable length generated when needed.  Minor or major
     variations of such a population or process can be easily
     implemented by modifying the statements, so as to give the
     simulation the flexibility needed for survival on repeated
     use in the hands of different instructors and students.  An
     earlier example of this approach can be found in <a href="#cheng">Cheng et
     al. (1992)</a>.

<p>7    In the remainder of this paper, I describe briefly three
     such simulations that have been used with some success in
     classes of MBA students.  They may also be used in business
     statistics courses at the upper undergraduate level, other
     business courses with a substantial statistical component
     (e.g., in marketing research or management science), or in
     statistics courses having an applications orientation.  The
     full text of these simulations can be inspected at the web
     addresses given below.  The files of these documents, the
     computer programs, teaching and technical notes, and sample
     student responses are freely available to instructors.
     Instructions for obtaining this information are given at the
     end of this paper.



<h1>                2.  Norgas Distributing Company</h1>


<p> 8    Norgas is described as the exclusive supplier of natural gas
      to a large metropolitan area in the Great Lakes region.  At
      present, Norgas does not store gas and draws its daily
      supply directly from the main gas pipeline.  An opportunity
      arises to lease recently developed storage facilities
      located near the pipeline and the market.  Like other
      inventory, gas storage has the potential of reducing costs,
      allowing fluctuations in daily demand to be smoothed by
      buying more than is needed when the weather is warm and
      storing the excess supply for use when the weather is cold.
      The simulation was motivated by the operations of an
      existing gas utility.  An earlier version appears in <a href="#tryfos2">Tryfos
      (1998)</a>.

<p> 9    The objective of the simulation is to maximize next year's
      profit.  Up to ten years of data are available at a certain
      cost; the data show the daily gas consumption, actual
      temperature and wind speed, and one-day-ahead forecasts of
      these variables by two weather forecasting services.
      Students must first decide how many years of data to
      purchase.  After the data are analyzed, decisions must also
      be made concerning the weather service to subscribe to, the
      model to forecast next day's gas demand, whether or not
      storage facilities will be leased, the minimum annual
      quantity of gas to be purchased, and the maximum quantity of
      gas to be withdrawn on any day from the pipeline; if storage
      is leased, a commitment must also be made regarding the
      maximum quantities of gas to be stored and transported on
      any day in the storage pipeline.

<p>10    From the standpoint of statistical methods, the simulation
      touches on data analysis, regression, and time series
      analysis.  A special computer program generates daily actual
      and forecast weather characteristics and gas consumption for
      the number of years requested.



<h1>                   3.  Tenderdent Toothpaste</h1>


<p>11    The text of the simulation describes a situation faced by
      the chief executive officer (CEO) of a pharmaceutical
      company manufacturing a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  The
      CEO has persuaded the company's board of directors of the
      need to review the current promotional policy, which treats
      Tenderdent as a drug and is aimed at dentists and
      physicians.  The CEO proposes instead that the focus of
      advertising be the consumer and that Tenderdent be treated
      for promotional purposes like any other toothpaste.  The
      board is not convinced that a different advertising message
      will be effective or that the market for this type of
      toothpaste is large enough for advertising to be profitable
      but agrees with the CEO's plan to "proceed with caution" in
      three stages.  In the first stage, a survey of adults in a
      large metropolitan area will be commissioned to estimate the
      potential market for Tenderdent and the characteristics of
      potential buyers.  If the results of the survey are
      encouraging then, in the second stage, Tenderdent will be
      test marketed in selected regions of the country.  If the
      results of this test marketing in turn are encouraging, then
      in the third stage Tenderdent will be marketed in some or
      all of the regions in the country.

<p>12    The simulation was motivated by the experience of a
      successful company manufacturing a toothpaste for sensitive
      teeth; an earlier and simpler version can be found in <a href="#tryfos1">Tryfos
      (1996)</a>.

<p>13    In the first stage, decisions are required concerning the
      sampling method to be used (simple, stratified, or two-stage
      sample of households) and the sample size.  The second stage
      is an experiment, and decisions are needed regarding which
      regional markets to select on the basis of characteristics
      of these markets.  Finally, the third stage decisions
      suggest the estimation of a model relating advertising to
      sales based on the information gathered in the second stage,
      and the determination of the optimal level of advertising
      and production in each regional market.  As often happens in
      real life, the decisions at each stage represent
      commitments, and once made cannot be changed.  The objective
      is the maximization of the profit from the entire venture.

<p>14    From the standpoint of methods, the simulation involves
      sampling, data analysis, experimental design, and
      regression.  As in the other two simulations, optimization
      requires no more sophistication than enumeration and
      intelligent search.  Three special computer programs accept
      the student's decisions at each stage, generate the
      appropriate data in response to these decisions, and
      calculate the overall profit stemming from the entire
      sequence of decisions.



<h1>                4.  Superior Insurance Inc.</h1>


<p>15    A new system for a standardized third-party automobile
      liability insurance is legislated to come into effect at the
      start of next year.  Under the new system, the focus of
      insurance is the driver rather than the vehicle as with the
      existing system.  Superior Insurance is one of several
      companies competing in the region, and the task facing the
      student is to formulate Superior's new premium policy so as
      to maximize profits in the coming year.

<p>16    In essence, this means determining a "formula" by which the
      annual premium of a driver with given characteristics (such
      as gender, age, experience, and vehicle size) will be
      calculated.  Drivers are expected to request such premium
      quotations from all firms competing in the region, and to
      purchase insurance from the lowest bidder.  In anticipation
      of the new legislation, an industry organization coordinated
      the construction of a database showing for each licensed
      driver in a given year in the past the total amount of
      claims made as well as driver and vehicle characteristics.
      Students must decide how many records to purchase from this
      database in the form of a simple random sample.  A special
      computer program delivers this information, which must then
      be analyzed to determine the premium policy.

<p>17    A second computer program treats each student as a competing
      company, accepts the premium formula from each such company,
      and simulates next year's operations.  This is done by
      generating drivers and their characteristics, calculating
      the premium bid of each company, determining which company
      wins and sells the insurance policy, generating the amount
      of claim for each driver, and summing up to calculate the
      total revenue, total cost, and total profit for each
      competing company.

<p>18    From the standpoint of methods, the simulation involves
      sampling, data analysis, regression and other methods for
      predicting categories of attributes.



<h1>                 5.  Common Technical Features</h1>


<p>19    All three simulations can be described as large-scale,
      non-trivial problems involving large sets of data.  The data
      generated by the special programs are in the form of ASCII
      (text) files that can be read and analyzed with the help of
      spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel) or statistical programs
      (e.g., Minitab, SAS, or SPSS). The special programs are
      modest, "no-frills" DOS programs written in C.  Simple
      adjustments can be made requiring no knowledge of C
      programming or recompilation, so that the generated data can
      be made to vary from one use to another; other adjustments
      can be made by modifying the source code and recompiling the
      programs.  The Norgas and Tenderdent programs as well as the
      first Superior program can be executed in the form provided;
      however, the second Superior program simulating the market
      performance requires some knowledge of C and a C or C++
      compiler.

<p>20    With due respect to students' zeal for finding "solutions"
      with minimum effort, achieved by copying others' work or
      attempting to discover loopholes in the programs (to which
      zeal I can attest from experience), an effort was made to
      make the programs reasonably secure.  A password, controlled
      by the instructor, is needed to run each public program once
      only; also, provision is made for program files to be stored
      in protected server directories.  To avoid having to store
      large quantities of data, the programs generate data as they
      execute.  However, an instructor is able to replicate at any
      time any set of previously generated data if such
      replication is necessary to confirm or otherwise check
      student work.

<p>21    Instructions on all these technical features are provided in
      the Technical and Teaching Notes accompanying each
      simulation.



<h1>                    6.  Pedagogical Features</h1>


<p>22    A clear message is given that useful information is rarely
      free, and that the cost of additional information must
      somehow be related to the expected benefits.

<p>23    Each simulation has a single objective -- the maximization
      of profit under conditions of uncertainty.  Students are not
      directed to apply particular methods or to make particular
      assumptions.  Nevertheless, they appear to realize that in
      pursuing this purely business objective statistical methods
      are eminently reasonable and appropriate.

<p>24    Each simulation involves four stages corresponding to
      research, analysis, forecasting, and optimization, designed
      to be carried out over a period of time.  At each stage,
      students can be invited to reflect on how the task may be
      carried out.  There can follow a class discussion and
      lecture, after which students must make decisions and
      commitments.  In a final report and presentation students
      can explain the alternatives considered at each stage, their
      rationale for the decisions taken, and their expectations
      for the final outcome.

<p>25    Students can be evaluated in part by the profit they attain
      in relation to that of other students -- what that part
      should be can be left to the instructor's discretion.  Some
      recognition of attained profit is necessary to motivate
      students and provide an incentive for accurate work, but
      this need not be reflected in the student's grade.  It could
      be made clear that, very much as in the real world, results
      depend not only on actions under one's control, but also on
      events beyond it -- such as an unlikely but nevertheless
      observed "non-representative" sample, or a competitor's
      uncooperative behavior.  In my experience, business students
      have no difficulty accepting this view of the world.
      Indeed, I find that they welcome the challenge that
      competition provides and, especially if they work in teams,
      the opportunity to do better than their peers.

<p>26    Precisely this approach has been used in the required MBA
      course at York University referred to earlier.  The entire
      course, a seven-week introduction to quantitative methods,
      is centered on one of the simulations.  The 40 to 50
      students in each section form teams of their choice
      consisting of one to four members; the final report is due
      and a presentation is made on the last day of classes, on
      the very same day that the simulation results are announced.
      Each team's mark depends in large part on the quality of the
      paper and presentation and in small part on the profit
      achieved in relation to that of other teams.  The individual
      student's final grade depends also on the quality of his or
      her participation in class discussions.

<p>27    The simulations are used differently in an elective,
      fourth-year undergraduate or second-year graduate,
      one-semester econometrics course for business students.
      Here, one of the three simulations serves as a capstone case
      at the end of a sequence of six to eight smaller and less
      demanding cases, each of which is assigned to and presented
      by different students.  The student's final grade depends
      approximately equally on the cases, the selected simulation,
      and a final examination.

<p>28    A final pedagogical feature is aimed at the instructor,
      particularly one with background in methods only.  If indeed
      these simulations are convincing classroom descriptions of
      business problems, an instructor who places himself or
      herself in the position of the decision maker may wish to
      reflect on just which statistical methods among the many
      available are the most useful in addressing business
      problems.
