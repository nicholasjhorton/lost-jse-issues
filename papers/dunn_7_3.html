<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The baby boom dataset contains the time of birth, sex,
and birth weight for 44 babies born in one 24-hour period
at a hospital in Brisbane, Australia.  The data can be used
to demonstrate that some common distributions -- the
normal, binomial, geometric, Poisson, and exponential --
can be used to model real situations. Because the dataset
is small and easily understood, it provides a useful
classroom example for discussing these distributions. </p>

<p>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>1 Useful datasets may come from surprising places.  A
dataset that appeared in a local tabloid newspaper proved
to be of great value in teaching some common
distributions.  The dataset is easy to understand and small
enough that students can manipulate the data in class,
yet it can be used for demonstrating the normal, binomial,
geometric, Poisson, and exponential distributions.  We do
not claim that the distributions fitted to particular
variables are necessarily the 'best' fitting distributions
in any sense.  Rather, we show that the data follow
distributions that they could reasonably be expected to
follow.  In a course introducing common distributions, the
dataset demonstrates that these distributions can have
practical applications.  The dataset can also be used to
illustrate hypothesis tests about proportions, comparisons
of birth weights by gender, the runs test of randomness of
gender, and skewed data.   </p> 



<h1>2.  The Baby Boom Data </h1>

<p>2 These data appeared in an article entitled "Babies by
the Dozen for Christmas: 24-Hour Baby Boom" in the
newspaper <cite>The Sunday Mail</cite> on 
December&nbsp;21, 1997 (<a href="#steele">Steele
1997</a>).  According to the article, a record 44 babies
were born in one 24-hour period  at the Mater Mothers'
Hospital, Brisbane, Australia, on December&nbsp;18, 1997.  
The article listed the time of birth, the sex, and the
weight in grams for each of the 44 babies.</p>

<p>3 We use these data in a unit in which we discuss, among
other things, various discrete and continuous
distributions, along with the theory of distributions. 
Where possible, we try to use real datasets.  The present
dataset provides a common source of examples for use in a
number of situations.</p>

<p>4 The dataset contains four variables:  TIME, the time
each birth occurred, given on the 24-hour clock; SEX,
the sex of the baby, coded using 1 for a girl and 2 for a
boy; WEIGHT, the birth weight in grams; and MINSMID, the
number of minutes after midnight that each birth occurred. 
</p>


<h1>3. The Baby Boom in the Classroom </h1>

<p>5 These data have been used in various situations,
which are considered separately below.  The fits are
generally quite good for such a small dataset.   In the
classroom, a copy of the original article (which includes
the data) is given to each student.</p>

<p>6 In this article, <i>p</i>-values are given for the
goodness of fit of certain  distributions.  These
<i>p</i>-values have been calculated with the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in S-Plus <a href="#mathsoft">
(MathSoft 1997)</a> using <tt>ks.gof</tt>.  In the case of
the normal and exponential distributions, the null
hypotheses are composite; that is, the parameters of the
distribution have been estimated from the sample.  For the
other distributions, this facility is unavailable, and so
the <i>p</i>-values are computed under the assumptions that
the parameters of the distribution are known. This test
also assumes continuous data. Together with the small
sample sizes, the given <i>p</i>-values are only of limited
use, and are given only as a general indication of the
suitability of the distributions. (The <img width="21" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064229im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n3/chisq.gif" alt="$\chi^2$"> goodness-of-fit test is difficult to apply
in many cases because of small counts.)  For further
information, see, for example,  <a href="#daniel">Daniel
(1990, chap. 8)</a>.</p>


<h2>3.1 Binomial Distribution </h2>

<p>7 The 44 babies comprised 18 girls and 26 boys.  A simple
application of the binomial distribution is to determine
the probability that such an imbalance would occur if
indeed the probability of giving birth to a boy equaled
the probability of giving birth to a girl.  (This ignores
the well-known fact that the probability of a boy's being
born is slightly higher than the probability of a girl's
being born. Such information could, of course, be easily
included.)  The  probability of observing at least 26
babies of the same sex in 44 births is 0.2912 under this
assumption.  It is therefore not that unusual.</p>


<h2>3.2 Geometric Distribution </h2>

<p>8 The geometric distribution can be used to model the
number of births up to (and including) a boy's birth.  With
the small dataset, this exercise  takes less than ten
minutes.  We need to ignore the last three births (which
were all girls) to keep matters simple, and use the
estimate <img width="12" height="29" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064229im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n3/phat.gif" alt="$\hat p$"> = 26/41<img width="17" height="13" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="/web/20130307064229im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n3/approx.gif" alt="$\approx$">0.634
as the probability that a boy was born during this time.
The number of births until a boy was born can then be
tallied, restarting the count after each boy's birth. The
results are given in Table 1.  The fit appears to be
reasonable.   The <i>p</i>-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test is approximately 0.27,  indicating that there is
insufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis of the
geometric distribution as a possible model.</p>

<h2>3.3 Poisson Distribution </h2>

<p>9 The Poisson distribution can be used to model the
number of births each hour over the 24-hour period.  Again,
the theoretical probabilities (using a mean of 44/24<img width="17" height="13" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="/web/20130307064229im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n3/approx.gif" alt="$\approx$">1.83 births per hour) and  experimental
probabilities are calculated  and compared.  The task
again takes about ten minutes.  The results are  given in
Table 2.  The approximate <i>p</i>-value of the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is found to be 0.64, indicating
that there is insufficient evidence to reject the Poisson
distribution as a possible model.</p>

<h2>3.4 Exponential Distribution </h2>

<p>10 After fitting the Poisson distribution to the arrival
times, it is natural to try to model the times between
births using an exponential distribution.  This is a little
more tedious, and although it has been done in class, it
may be more suited to a tutorial exercise. The first birth
occurred at 0005, and the last birth in the 24-hour period
at 2355.  Thus the 43 inter-birth times happened over a
1430-minute period, giving a theoretical mean of
1430/43 = 33.26 minutes between births.  The theoretical
probabilities (calculated before the class in this
situation) are found by integrating between the class
boundaries.  That is, the theoretical probability for the
first class is found by integrating between 0.0 and 19.5,
for the second class by integrating between 19.5 and 39.5,
and so on. The results are given in Table 3. The fit in
this case is again quite good; the <i>p</i>-value using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for composite exponentiality is
0.24.</p>

<h2>3.5 The Normal Distribution </h2>

<p>11 Another modeling exercise is to model the birth
weights using a normal distribution. Not surprisingly, the
birth weights are not modeled very well by a normal
distribution.  Babies born prematurely or with illnesses,
and many other factors contribute to the
non-normality.  One would generally expect, given these
factors, that the distribution would tend to be skewed to
the left.</p>

<p>12 Before displaying the data, these issues have been
discussed with the students. Thus, before seeing the data,
they  expect to see a negatively skewed distribution.  The
Q-Q plot for the data  is shown in <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>. The <i>p</i>-value for a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of composite normality is 0.0007.
The students are not surprised by such a plot, and they
suggest that grouping the babies by gender would be
sensible.   The corresponding Q-Q plots are shown in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>, and the <i>p</i>-values for 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of composite normality are 0.0283
(girls) and 0.106 (boys). We can conclude, then, that the
distributions by gender remain negatively skewed;
separating the dataset by gender does not greatly improve
the fit of the normal distribution.</p>

<h1>4. Conclusion </h1>

<p>13 The simple dataset given in <a href="#steele">Steele
(1997)</a> is useful and constructive in the classroom.
Because the dataset is small and easily understood,
distributions can be fitted to the data in the class by the
students. Despite its small size, the dataset demonstrates
useful applications of many common distributions, even if
the fitted distributions are not necessarily optimal. </p>


<h1>5. Getting The Data</h1>
