<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p> Students in an applied statistics course offering some
nonparametric methods are often (subconsciously) restricted
in modeling their research problems by what they have
learned from the <i>t</i>-test.  When moving from
parametric to nonparametric models, they do not have a good
idea of the variety and richness of general location
models.  In this paper, the simple context of the
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test is used to illustrate
alternatives where &quot;one distribution is to the right of
the other.&quot;  For those situations, it is also argued (and
demonstrated by examples) that a plausible research
question about a real-world experiment needs a precise
formulation, and that hypotheses about a single parameter
may need additional assumptions.  A full and explicit
description of underlying models is not always available in
standard textbooks.</p>


<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>1 An introductory course on applied nonparametric
statistics often contains a chapter on the two-sample
problem, referring students to the analogy of the
<i>t</i>-test they have encountered before. The
nonparametric framework, however, gives rise to a much wider
variety of location models, and spending some time with
students on this issue is worthwhile.  When comparing two
treatments, the word &quot;better&quot; in the statement &quot;new is
better than old&quot; must be understood in the sense that
better is reflected in higher outcomes, and hence that one
is looking for a &quot;difference in level&quot; if there is a
difference to be detected at all.  Of course, &quot;new is
better than old&quot; may instead be reflected in lower
outcomes, and situations where this happens are numerous
(e.g., severity of toxicity or number of suicide
attempts).  The crucial point in both cases is the
detection of a difference in level (as opposed to a
difference, e.g., in variability). The old treatment is
represented by <i>X</i> and the new one by <i>Y</i>.  The
notation

refers to the fact that random variables are &quot;equal in distribution.&quot;</p>

<p>2 This paper focuses on issues encountered at the design
stage of a study where, backed by substantial knowledge
about the field in which the experiment takes place, one is
led to make plausible research assumptions to be tested
statistically.  One of the natural assumptions for location
is that &quot;one distribution is to the right of the other,&quot;
and within this context the WMW test is often used.  Even
within this restricted framework, the richness of models
and the tradition of focusing on parameters warrant a
precise formulation of the problem.  How this can be done,
and how possible pitfalls should be avoided, are the main
themes of this paper.</p>

<p>3 In order to focus on the main ideas, we do not consider
important, but mathematically more involved, topics such as
ties. Also, fundamental problems that might arise at the
analysis stage concerning the &quot;truth&quot; of the alternative
hypothesis are outside the scope of this paper.</p>

<h1>2. The Parametric Heritage</h1>

<p>4 University students enrolled in applied statistics
courses usually start by being exposed to the two-sample
<i>t</i>-test for comparing &quot;two things&quot; (treatments,
drugs, fertilizers, machines, ...). 
The focus of the comparison lies in detecting a difference
in level, where typically the new treatment yields higher
outcomes than the old one, if it is to be declared the
better one.</p>

<p>5 The classical  parametric framework rephrases the above
research question in terms of means. A test of whether a
new treatment <i>Y</i> (with mean response
<img width="28" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img3.gif" alt="$\mu_Y$">)
is better than the old treatment <i>X</i> (with mean response <img width="29" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img4.gif" alt="$\mu_X$">)
looks like 
<img width="94" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img5.gif" alt="$H_0:\Delta = 0$">
versus 
<img width="94" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img6.gif" alt="$H_1:\Delta > 0$">
with 
<img width="116" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img7.gif" alt="$\Delta = \mu_Y-\mu_X$">.
The model for carrying out the test starts with 
<img width="60" height="40" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img8.gif" alt="$\overline{Y} - \overline{X}$">,
the sample analogue of the population quantity of interest. 
Up to this point, students have the impression that they
understand what's going on. Next comes what they consider
&quot;technical details making the mathematics work.&quot; Indeed,
they ultimately need to be able to judge the
significance of their sample outcome, and hence need the
appropriate yardstick and its distribution. Standard
textbooks state that the properly standardized statistic
looks like 
<img width="233" height="46" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img9.gif" alt="$(\overline{Y}-\overline{X})/\sqrt{S^2_p(1/n_1 + 1/n_2)}$">,
and that, under <i>H</i><sub>0</sub>, it has a 
<i>t</i>(<i>n</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>n</i><sub>2</sub>-2)
distribution when the underlying populations are normal
with the same variance. Some texts comment on a
Welch-type approximation for unequal variances and on
approximately symmetrical and/or approximately normal
populations for not-too-small sample sizes.</p>

<p>6 For the student (and for many applied researchers using
statistics), all the above boils down to the fact that
proving &quot;new better than old&quot; is captured by differences
in means, and that one has to carefully consider the
plausibility of the &quot;technical constraints&quot; (normality,
equality of variance) in the experiment at hand for the (pooled)
<i>t</i>-test to be the statistical procedure of choice.
What usually escapes attention is that the basic
formulation of the two-sample <i>t</i>-test is about
location in a shift model.  A simple picture of a normal
shift model shows that one number (the difference of means)
captures the complete behaviour of a population change.
Although this property is very well known, its consequences
are seldom stated explicitly, let alone checked in real
experiments, before carrying out a test.</p>

<p>7 Performing tests on location-type problems while
(implicitly) thinking and (explicitly) acting as if they
are shift problems is so common that &quot;the location
problem&quot; has become synonymous with &quot;the shift problem&quot; in
very many textbooks. That this reflects the assumption of a
constant additive improvement is seldom, if ever,
mentioned. Formulation of location hypotheses in a
nonparametric framework helps to give shift problems their
proper place in a broader picture.</p>


<p>8 As mentioned above, we assume that over the range of
data under consideration, &quot;higher&quot; is either always
better than &quot;lower&quot; or always worse.  Of course, there
are variables, like level of arousal (described by such
terms as torpid, normal, and hyperactive) or trust in
strangers (from too trusting to overly suspicious), that
are optimal at intermediate values and for which &quot;higher&quot;
is not always better (or always worse) than &quot;lower.&quot;</p>

<p>9 While restricting attention to &quot;level differences,&quot;
there are, nevertheless, plenty of real life problems where
the &quot;constant additive shift model&quot; does not hold.  A
simple example could be an exam preparation company
claiming to be able to improve scores by a fixed number of
points, although there is a maximum possible score on the
exam. 
</p>

<p>10 Instances of variables with restricted range are numerous,
and an outstanding family of examples is connected with
lifetimes.
In parametric statistics, a very simple model would start
with the exponential distribution.  Assume that the old
treatment <i>X</i> is distributed as an exponential 
with failure rate <img width="34" height="37" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img10.gif" alt="$1/\lambda$">
(and hence with mean
<img width="16" height="18" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/lambda.gif" alt="$\lambda$">, and that the new treatment <i>Y</i> is also exponential, but with failure rate <img width="35" height="37" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img12.gif" alt="$1/\mu$">
(with
<img width="90" height="37" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img13.gif" alt="$1/\mu < 1/\lambda$">).  
Since the exponential distribution is determined by a single parameter, 
the difference between the two populations could be specified by a 
difference in means 
<img width="91" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img14.gif" alt="$\Delta = \mu - \lambda$">.
Hence, for a fixed type of distribution (exponential), one could 
formulate a test in terms of an increase in means only

11 The above properties of the exponential are, of course, well-known.  Engineers, when studying reliability
problems, often use the exponential and model a change as a ratio 
<img width="71" height="37" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img18.gif" alt="$ \theta = \mu/\lambda$">.
Turning to the nonparametric analogue, biostatisticians look for
instances where proportional hazards are a plausible assumption for
modeling survival data in clinical trials.  Here, also, longer survival
times are not modeled as a &quot;constant additive shift.&quot;</p>


<h1>3. A Nonparametric Framework</h1>

<p>12 For many students, comparing two treatments the
nonparametric way reduces to clicking &quot;Wilcoxon&quot; instead
of &quot;Student <i>t</i>&quot; in a statistical computer package
or replacing mean by median in a report. This often
reflects an almost automatic transposition of the
parametric model to the nonnormal situation,
again restricting attention to one number, be it the median
in this case. Abandoning the normality assumption, however,
allows one to abandon the induced shift model
altogether. It invites one to delve a bit deeper into the
understanding of basic model properties of the treatments
one wants to compare. The context of the Wilcoxon test can
be an ideal starting point for this mental exercise. </p>

<p>13 How much flexibility can be incorporated into a
nonparametric &quot;new better than old&quot; statement, while still
ending up with a treatable expression? The classical answer
to this question  (see, e.g., <a href="#lehmann98">Lehmann 1998</a>, p. 66, or <a href="#bickel">Bickel and Doksum 1977</a>, p. 345) involves stochastic
ordering, and this topic deserves ample explanation when
students are exposed to it for the first time. If <i>X</i>
stands for the (population of outcomes of the) old
treatment and <i>Y</i> for the new one, one could define
&quot;new better than old&quot; as <i>Y</i> is stochastically
larger than <i>X</i>. Denoting the cumulative distribution functions (c.d.f's) of <i>X</i> and
<i>Y</i> by <i>F</i>(·) and <i>G</i>(·), 
the stochastic ordering is expressed as &quot;<i>F</i>(<i>x</i>)
<img width="20" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/geq.gif" alt="$\geq$">
 <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>)
for all <i>x</i>, with  <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) &gt;
<i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) for at least one <i>x</i>.&quot; Most
textbooks warn the students here of the apparent mistake in
the direction of the inequality sign, essentially telling
them that up until now, they haven't given the
interpretation of a cumulative distribution function enough
thought. </p>

<p>14 A definition of &quot;stochastically
larger than&quot; will not be very helpful unless students are
able to relate this concept to familiar situations.
Well-chosen examples and pictures are crucial here. We
illustrate this with some useful pictures and descriptive
phrases, starting with the well-known shift model.</p>


<h1>4. The Classical Shift Model</h1>

<p>15 The two-sample location problem is one of the most
widely studied  problems in mathematical statistics.
Restricting attention to shift models 
<img width="100" height="49" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img17.gif" alt="$Y \stackrel{d}{=} X + \Delta$">
(or

nice optimality properties of specific tests have been
proved (e.g., the <i>t</i>-test is uniformly most powerful
for  a normal shift, and the Wilcoxon test is locally most
powerful for a logistic shift).  However, for all shift
models, one should keep in mind that testing
<img width="94" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img5.gif" alt="$H_0:\Delta = 0$">

reflects one's belief that the improvement in the new
treatment shows itself in a &quot;constant additive&quot; way.</p>

<p>16 The improvement in the outcomes of the new treatment
is a fixed quantity
<img width="55" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img25.gif" alt="$\Delta > 0$">
added (in a probabilistic sense) to the outcomes of the old treatment, and this
property holds uniformly over the whole range of the
experiment (<a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>). Formulated in this way, the implication of a shift
model seems rather drastic, and students at this point
start having a hard time believing that any of their own
experiments will ever comply with such a model. Some of
them might even confess that they had not previously given
the idea of constant additivity any consideration while
routinely carrying out two-sample <i>t</i>-tests. </p>

 The improvement is additive and constant over the whole range of observable
outcomes.

<h1>5. Location and Stochastic Ordering</h1>

<p>17 A natural way to allow more flexibility in modeling

The flexibility of modeling a new treatment

 clearly shows that one expects higher values for the new
treatment, allowing at the same time for dependence of the
degree of improvement on the value at hand. This model
makes sense for a variety of experiments. It
essentially replaces &quot;<i>Y</i> is stochastically larger
than <i>X</i>&quot; by the following sentence which is usually
better understood: &quot;For any fixed value
<i>x</i><sub>0</sub>, the probability that the new treatment
yields outcomes higher than <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> is
bigger than the probability that the old treatment yields
outcomes higher than <i>x</i><sub>0</sub>.&quot;</p>

<p>19 Note that the above model is also
handy for teaching testing procedures in more specialized
settings. A notable example is 
<img width="132" height="49" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img26.gif" alt="$Y\stackrel{d}{=}X+\Delta(X)$">

 for <i>a</i> &gt; 0 and <i>X</i> a positive random variable
(lifetime), modeled by the exponential. The nonparametric
analogue in this case leads to the (simple) proportional
hazards model, a subclass of the &quot;stochastically larger
than&quot; model for which the Savage - Exponential Scores
- Logrank test is the statistical method of choice.</p>

<p>20 It might be worthwhile in its own right to acquaint
students with the concept of &quot;stochastically larger than&quot;
through simulation.  Start with a distribution of <i>X</i>
and a deterministic function 
<img width="80" height="37" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img27.gif" alt="$\Delta(x) \geq 0$">,
not everywhere zero.  Take a random sample 
<i>X</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>, ... , <i>X<sub>m</sub></i>
from the <i>X</i> population.  Then,
independently of the first sample, take another random sample 
<i>X</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>, ... , <i>X<sub>n</sub></i>
from <i>X</i> and
construct 
<i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>, ... , <i>Y<sub>n</sub></i>
through

 for the second sample.  This procedure may help to make
clear the notion that there has been an intervention so
that <i>Y</i> is &quot;improved&quot; over <i>X</i>.  At the same
time it clearly shows that &quot;<i>Y</i> tends to be larger
than <i>X</i>&quot; must be understood in a probabilistic
sense.</p>


<h1>6. The Reparameterization Fallacy</h1>

<p>21 Pictures like those in <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a> acquaint students
with the &quot;stochastically larger than&quot; model. At this point,
however, some students intuitively go back to numbers,
remarking that in both pictures the median of the new
treatment is clearly the larger one. So why not formulate
the test as 
<img width="111" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img34.gif" alt="$H_0:\theta_Y=\theta_X$">
versus 
<img width="111" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img35.gif" alt="$H_1:\theta_Y > \theta_X$">

the median? </p>

<p>22 Another common observation is that if the probability
of exceeding any <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> is bigger for the new
treatment than for the old one, then 
<nobr><i>P</i>(<i>Y</i> &gt; <i>X</i>) &gt; .5,</nobr> 
whereas 
<nobr><i>P</i>(<i>Y</i> &gt; <i>X</i>) = .5</nobr> 
if there is no treatment
effect. So why not formulate the test as 
<nobr><i>H</i><sub>0</sub> : <i>P</i>(<i>Y</i> &gt; <i>X</i>) = .5</nobr> 
versus

<p>23 At this point, <a href="#Figure4">Figure 4</a> is crucial, showing that the
stochastic ordering is only a partial one, and hence that
models based on this ordering cannot be collapsed into
statements about simple numbers.</p>

25 An analogous argument holds for 
<nobr><i>P</i>(<i>Y</i> &gt; <i>X</i>),</nobr> 
and, furthermore, one can construct examples where
<nobr><i>P</i>(<i>Y</i> &gt; <i>X</i>) = .5</nobr> 
but
<img width="72" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img41.gif" alt="$\theta_Y \neq \theta_X$">
or where

but 
<nobr><i>P</i>(<i>Y</i> &gt; <i>X</i>) &gt; .5.</nobr> 
A claim that 
<nobr><i>P</i>(<i>Y</i> &gt; <i>X</i>) &gt; .5</nobr> 
reflects superiority of the new treatment 
could be hard to relate to by the student who is convinced
that for almost half of the outcome range the old treatment
outperforms the new one (see <a href="#Figure7">Figure 7</a>). Thinking that 
<nobr><i>P</i>(<i>Y</i> &gt; <i>X</i>) = .5</nobr> 
is one of the many equivalent ways of saying that there
isn't any difference between new and old can be misleading
too (see <a href="#Figure8">Figure 8</a>). </p>

<p>26 When studying specific properties of a particular
experiment, there might be a good reason for formulating
the research question strictly in terms of the median (or
in terms of 
<nobr><i>P</i>(<i>Y</i> &gt; <i>X</i>)).</nobr>
However, one should then realize that in nonparametric models, two
distributions need not be equal under the null hypothesis
if it is stated as 
<img width="111" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img34.gif" alt="$H_0:\theta_Y=\theta_X$">
(see <a href="#Figure5">Figure 5</a>).  The null distribution of the WMW statistic
(and more generally, of a permutation statistic) can then
no longer be determined since the  nice and simple
nonparametric distribution of the sum of the treatment
ranks stems from the basic assumption that treatment and
control are identically distributed under the null hypothesis.</p>

<p>27 When a problem is formulated in terms of medians,
while assuming implicitly that the distributions have the
same shape, this assumption should be mentioned explicitly,
leading to a null hypothesis of the form 
<i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>).  In fact, even the
nonparametric Behrens-Fisher problem (see <a href="#lehmann91">Lehmann 1991</a>, p. 323), where the two
populations are modeled as 
<img width="112" height="37" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img43.gif" alt="$F((x - \xi)/\sigma)$">
and
<img width="111" height="37" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img44.gif" alt="$F((y-\eta)/\tau)$">,
does not justify the use of WMW for testing 
<img width="88" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img45.gif" alt="$H_0 : \xi = \eta$">.
Indeed,  <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) is not
guaranteed under the null hypothesis, nor  is stochastic
ordering under the alternative hypothesis.</p>


<h1>7. Exploring the Literature</h1>

<p>28 Not many textbooks pay ample attention to explicitly
stating the underlying model, before indulging in the
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test procedure.  Formulation of
hypotheses in the collapsed way (e.g., on the median) is
not always put in its shift model framework, nor is the
necessity for such a model motivated. Mixing stochastic and
numerical ordering leads to amazing statements and sloppy
expressions, especially for two-sided tests. When students
explore standard textbooks such as <a href="#conover">Conover (1980)</a>, <a href="#gibbons">Gibbons and Chakraborti (1992)</a>, <a href="#hollander">Hollander and Wolfe (1973)</a>, <a href="#lehmann98">Lehmann (1998)</a>, <a href="#noether">Noether (1991)</a>, <a href="#randles">Randles and Wolfe (1991)</a>, and <a href="#siegel">Siegel and Castellan (1988)</a>, they will
encounter examples of the three situations described in
Sections 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3.</p>



<h2>7.1 A Precise Formulation</h2>

<p>29 As mentioned above, stochastic ordering must be
treated carefully in the formulation of hypotheses,
with special attention to two-sided tests. Examples of carefully stated hypotheses are
<p>
<i>H</i><sub>0</sub> : <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) versus 
<i>H</i><sub>1</sub> : <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>)
<img width="20" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/leq.gif" alt="$\leq$">
<i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) with inequality for at least one <i>x</i>
(new is better than old), <br>
<i>H</i><sub>0</sub> : <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) versus 
<i>H</i><sub>1</sub> : <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>)
<img width="20" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/geq.gif" alt="$\geq$"> 
 <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) with inequality for at least one <i>x</i>
(new is worse than old), and <br>
<i>H</i><sub>0</sub> : <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) versus <i>H</i><sub>1</sub>: either 
<i>G</i>(<i>x</i>)
<img width="20" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/leq.gif" alt="$\leq$">
<i>F</i>(<i>x</i>)
or
<i>G</i>(<i>x</i>)
<img width="20" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/geq.gif" alt="$\geq$">
<i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) with inequality for at least one <i>x</i>
(new differs from old in the sense that it is either
stochastically larger than old or that it is stochastically
smaller than old (see again <a href="#Figure4">Figure 4</a>)).  Hypotheses formulated in this way can be found,
e.g., in <a href="#lehmann98">Lehmann (1998)</a> and <a href="#noether">Noether (1991)</a>. </p>


<h2>7.2 A Restricted Formulation</h2>

<p>30 Several textbooks present the WMW test in a restricted
setting, but only some mention this setting explicitly. If
one is convinced that the improvement can be modeled as a shift, a formulation of the test as 
<img width="111" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img34.gif" alt="$H_0:\theta_Y=\theta_X$">
versus 
<img width="111" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img35.gif" alt="$H_1:\theta_Y > \theta_X$">
(or 
<img width="72" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img15.gif" alt="$\theta_Y < \theta_X$">
or 
<img width="72" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img41.gif" alt="$\theta_Y \neq \theta_X$">)
 creates no particular problem for the use of the WMW
statistic.  Some textbooks do indeed draw attention to the
restricted framework of a shift model, but others do not. 
As mentioned above, <i>p</i>-values computed for a WMW
test based solely on the assumption 
<img width="111" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img34.gif" alt="$H_0:\theta_Y=\theta_X$">
about medians can be completely wrong.</p>


<h2>7.3 Some Confusion</h2>

<p>31 When one agrees that a nonparametric framework naturally
calls for hypotheses on ordered distribution functions
rather than on parameters, it should be kept in mind that a
stochastic ordering is only partial. A two-sided test should
reflect this. </p>

<p>32 Typical confusion arises from intermingling stochastic
ordering and numerical ordering, as shown in the following
statement where a two-sided test for stochastically ordered
alternatives was intended:
</p>

<center> <table> 
<tr><td>
<i>H</i><sub>0</sub> : <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) 
for all <i>x</i>
</td></tr>
<tr><td> 
<i>H</i><sub>1</sub> : <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) 
<img width="19" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/neq.gif" alt="$\neq$">
<i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) 
for some <i>x</i> 
</td></tr>
</table> </center>

It is clear that the class of alternatives is much too
broad here. Similar problems may arise in &quot;reparameterized&quot;
statements such as 
<nobr><i>H</i><sub>1</sub> : <i>P</i>(<i>Y</i>
&gt; <i>X</i>)
<img width="19" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/neq.gif" alt="$\neq$">
 .5</nobr> or
 <img width="111" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="/web/20130307064239im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n2/callae.img16.gif" alt="$H_1 : \theta_Y \neq
\theta_X$">,
if additional assumptions on the underlying distributions
are not  specified.</p>


<h1>8. Conclusion</h1>

<p>33 For comparing two treatments, the <i>t</i>-test should
be included in an applied statistics course. But should the
<i>t</i>-test be the first (and sometimes the only) statistical
procedure that students see? Or should one start with a
nonparametric framework and dare to spend an
increased amount of teaching time on underlying
model assumptions illustrated with ample pictures and descriptive
phrases? After all, students should learn that in the
design and analysis of a real-world experiment, the first
thing to think hard about is the experiment. Its expected
behaviour, plausible properties, and the differences of interest all play a crucial role in the 
formulation of the research question and, consequently, in
the selection of an appropriate test statistic. An
overemphasis on the widely used <i>t</i>-test can give the
impression that a location difference between two
treatments must be modeled as a shift.</p>

<p>34 Considering the non-monotonicity, the sensitivity to
outliers, the small gain in efficiency when the underlying
model really is a normal shift, and the constant additivity
formulation of the <i>t</i>-test, one is forced to agree with <a href="#noether">Noether (1991</a>,
pp. 134-135), who wrote: &quot;Quite a number of statisticians, ... , 
are convinced that there are rarely, if ever, sound statistical
reasons for preferring the <i>t</i>-test to the Wilcoxon test.&quot;</p>
