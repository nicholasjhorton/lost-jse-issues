</p><h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>An alternative perspective is presented for teaching
students the logic and details underlying McNemar's test of
the equality of correlated proportions.  The new
perspective enables straightforward extension to other
correlated proportions situations.</p>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>1 It should come as no great revelation to teachers of
introductory applied statistics courses that often students
do not see the conceptual forest for the computational
trees.  In a previous article (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#serlin">Serlin and
Levin 1996</a>), we described a forest-seeking method that
capitalizes on the more-intuitive binomial probability
formula to elucidate the less-intuitive hypergeometric
probability formula.  A trick used for doing that was
simply to encourage students to view the conventionally
presented <nobr>2 × 2</nobr> frequency table from a
different perspective.  In particular, transposing the rows
and columns of that table leads directly to a
binomial-related approach to understanding the components
of the hypergeometric formula.  In the present note, we
illustrate how the seemingly mysterious test of correlated
proportions developed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#mcnemar">McNemar
(1947)</a> can be viewed from an alternative, more
comprehensible, perspective. Contemporary theoretical and
empirical efforts in statistics pedagogy highlight the
importance of relating new instructional material to
students' existing conceptual structures (e.g., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#derry">Derry, Levin, and Schauble 1995</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#lajoie">Lajoie 1998</a>).  With the alternative
McNemar perspective, generalizations of the procedure to
more complex situations are straightforward and similarly
more comprehensible.</p>

<h1>2. McNemar's Test of Correlated Proportions</h1>

<p>2 In most beginning social-sciences statistics courses,
standard hypothesis-testing fare includes the one-, two-,
and correlated-sample tests of means, along with the one-
and two-sample tests of proportions.  Conspicuously absent
from this list is McNemar's test of correlated proportions,
often referred to as McNemar's test of "change."  More
properly, however, the procedure represents a test of
symmetrical change among those cases in which change
actually occurred.  Alternatively, and as will be
illustrated here, the procedure can be conceptualized as a
test of the equality of correlated proportions, even in
"nonchange" situations. </p>

<p>3 Of what utility is such a statistical test? 
Researchers often employ dichotomous dependent variables in
a pretest-posttest design to evaluate change or in a
matched-pair design to assess the effectiveness of an
intervention.  Examples of common dichotomous variables of
interest include yes-no attitude items and
criterion-referenced measures or right-wrong items on a
performance test.  Of course, from dichotomous variables
spring proportions, and just as it is of interest to
measure change in mean performance over time, it is
frequently of interest to assess changes in proportions (or
percentages) over time.  For instance, one might wish to
document the percentage of prospective voters who change
their views of a particular presidential candidate from
February to November or the percentage of respondents who
become more supportive of a controversial piece of proposed
legislation following a statewide media blitz.  In a
nonrepeated-measures research context, one may wish to
compare the performance of specially instructed
participants with their matched-pair control counterparts
on a dichotomously scored item or on a pass-fail mastery
test.  In that regard, it should be noted that in
situations where matching has been employed, comparing the
proportions of "successful" instructed and uninstructed
participants via a two-sample chi-square test of
homogeneity is not statistically appropriate -- just as an
independent samples <i>t</i> test would not be appropriate
for assessing a difference in means between the two matched
samples.</p>

<p>4 With a single sample and a two-period study as an
example, the data are typically arrayed in a <nobr>2
× 2</nobr> table in which one margin represents the
two Time 1 categories, the other margin represents the two
Time 2 categories, and the test of the hypothesis of equal
marginal probabilities is conducted using the McNemar
test.  Consider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table1">Table 1</a>, which
depicts, say, the number of students who solve a particular
problem correctly both toward the beginning (Time 1) and
toward the end (Time 2) of a mathematics course.  If we let
<i>n<sub>ij</sub></i>  denote the frequency of observations
falling in the <i>i</i>th Time 1 and <i>j</i>th Time 2
categories (<i>i</i>, <i>j</i> = 1, 2), and with common
"dot" notation to represent summation, the total sample
size is given by <i>n</i><sub>··</sub>.  The
<i>n<sub>ij</sub></i> follow a multinomial distribution,
and the null hypothesis can be written in terms of the
marginal probabilities of interest,
<i>p</i><sub><i>i</i>·</sub> and
<i>p</i><sub>·<i>i</i></sub>, as:</p>

<h2>2.1  Conventional Approach</h2>

<p>5 With respect to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table1">Table 1</a>, let the
effective sample size be <i>N'</i> = <i>n</i><sub>12</sub>
+ <i>n</i><sub>21</sub>, the number of observations in the
two "change" cells.  For <i>N'</i> <img align="middle" border="0" src="./levin_8_2_files/geq.gif"> 10, the chi-square distribution
with 1 degree of freedom provides a reasonable
approximation to the multinomial probability associated
with the McNemar test statistic,</p>

<center>
<img align="middle" src="./levin_8_2_files/chisq.gif"> = (<i>n</i><sub>12</sub> - <i>n</i><sub>21</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/(<i>n</i><sub>12</sub> + <i>n</i><sub>21</sub>).
</center>


<p>(A continuity correction, reflected in the numerator as
(|<i>n</i><sub>12</sub> - <i>n</i><sub>21</sub>| -
1)<sup>2</sup>, could be included to improve the
approximation.)  If this test statistic exceeds the
alpha-level critical chi-square value, then it is concluded
that the two marginal probabilities,
<i>p</i><sub><i>i</i>·</sub> and
<i>p</i><sub>·<i>i</i></sub>, are not equal, or in
the case of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table1">Table 1</a>, that the
probability of solving the problem correctly is not the
same on the two occasions.</p>


<p>6 In introductory social-science statistics texts that
cover McNemar's test -- and many do not! -- the test is
typically described in terms of the just-presented form of
the test statistic (see, for example, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#ferguson">Ferguson and Takane 1989</a>, pp. 200-202;
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#glass">Glass and Hopkins 1996</a>, pp. 339-340;
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#hays">Hays 1994</a>, pp. 865-866).  From a
pedagogical standpoint, that form of the test essentially
comes "out of nowhere" and without a development that
allows students to relate it to previously learned tests,
such as the Pearson goodness-of-fit chi-square test.</p>


<h2>2.2  Alternative Perspective</h2>

<p>7 For the <nobr>2 × 2</nobr> table under
examination, <i>p</i><sub>1·</sub> =
<i>p</i><sub>11</sub> + <i>p</i><sub>12</sub> and
<i>p</i><sub>·1</sub> = <i>p</i><sub>11</sub> +
<i>p</i><sub>21</sub>, which means that the null hypothesis
in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Equation1">(1)</a> is equivalent to the
hypothesis that the probabilities in the two change cells
are equal,</p>

<center>
<i>H</i><sub>0</sub>: <i>p</i><sub>12</sub> = <i>p</i><sub>21</sub>.
</center>

<p>This restated null hypothesis allows us to shift our
focus from the margins of the table to just the two change
cells.  With attention restricted to those cells and with
equal change cell probabilities specified under the null
hypothesis, the <i>N'</i> observations in the change cells
are equally likely to fall into one or the other change
cell.  Accordingly, <i>n</i><sub>12</sub> follows a
binomial distribution with sample size <i>N'</i> and
probability parameter <i>p</i> = 0.5.  For <i>N'</i> &lt;
10, the binomial test will provide valid significance
probabilities.  For <i>N'</i> <img align="middle" border="0" src="./levin_8_2_files/geq.gif"> 10, students are reminded that
the one-sample test of proportions, <i>H</i><sub>0</sub>:
<i>p</i> = 0.5, can be conducted either as a normal
distribution <i>z</i> test or as its squared equivalent, a
one-degree-of-freedom chi-square goodness-of-fit test. (It
can readily be shown that a statistical test that focuses
on just the "change" cells is identical to a test of the
equality of the corresponding multinomial proportions based
on the entire table.)  For the chi-square case, the test is
presented in terms of the familiar "observed" (<i>O</i>)
and "expected" (<i>E</i>) cell frequencies as applied to a
2 × 1 table consisting only of the two change cell
frequencies (<i>n</i><sub>12</sub> and
<i>n</i><sub>21</sub> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table1">Table 1</a>). 
The goodness-of-fit test yields a value that is
identical to that of the conventional McNemar test.</p>

<h2>2.3  Example</h2>

<p>8 We now illustrate both the conventional and alternative
versions of McNemar's test through actual data that were
collected in the first author's introductory educational
statistics course, based on a total of 186 students over
five semesters.  The example provides an underused
hypothesis-testing application of McNemar's test, namely,
assessing the equality of two proportions associated with
two different dichotomous variables at the same point in
time.  For instance, one might wish to determine whether
the proportions of respondents who agree with two different
questionnaire items are the same, or whether two items on a
test are of equal difficulty, as reflected by the
proportion of test takers who get each item correct.  In
terms of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table1">Table 1</a> layout, if the
focus were on only a single test occasion (e.g., the first
test) and the "Time" label were permuted to read "Item,"
one might wish to determine whether two different items are
of equal difficulty.</p>

<p>9 As adapted to our statistics-course example, on the
first day of class students are given a 10-item "arithmetic
quiz" (essentially a simple algebra test) to assess their
readiness for the course.  The test consists of five pairs
of items, with the items in each pair tapping the same
underlying mathematical operation (i.e., the items
comprising each pair are structurally equivalent) but
presented in one of two different formats: symbolic or
verbal.  For instance, for one pair of items, the typical
symbolically presented format is "Solve for <i>p</i>: 3/5 =
<i>p</i>/250."  The corresponding verbal format for the
same problem is "About two people in five across the
country read <cite>Time</cite> magazine.  How many people
would we expect to read <cite>Time</cite> in a random
sample of 200 people?"  Thus, the second format includes
exactly the same underlying structure and required solution
operations as the first, but it is presented in a verbal
context rather than symbolically.  Each problem and its
paired counterpart are randomly interspersed throughout the
test, with separate total scores calculated for the
symbolically and verbally presented problems.</p>

<p>10 In addition to the face value of assessing students'
entering mathematical skill as a predictor of their
success in the course, the algebra test is used to
illustrate a variety of principles related to hypothesis
formulation, research design, and statistical inference. 
For instance, an intuitively understandable hypothesis
relates to students' often-reported states of "statistics
anxiety" and "symbol shock": Although most students possess
the prerequisite mathematical problem-solving skills for
the course, they will not demonstrate them as well on
algebra questions presented in less familiar, more
anxiety-producing terms (symbolic) as they will on
questions presented in more familiar everyday contexts
(verbal).  If "mastery" is defined as correctly answering
all five problems of a particular format (symbolic or
verbal), one could ask: Do beginning statistics students
demonstrate equivalent mastery of verbally and symbolically
stated algebra problems?  The results are summarized in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table2">Table 2</a>.  Applying the conventional
McNemar formula yields <nobr><img align="middle" src="./levin_8_2_files/chisq.gif"> = (31 - 33)<sup>2</sup>/(31 + 33) =
0.06</nobr>, which, based on a Type I error probability of
.05, indicates that the difference in marginal proportions
is not statistically significant.  Thus, contrary to the
research hypothesis, it would be concluded that the
proportions of students exhibiting mastery of the two
different problem formats, verbal (107/186 = .575) and
symbolic (105/186 = .564), do not differ significantly.  As
an aside, the hypothesis was tested nondirectionally in
this example because it is not difficult to construct an
equally appealing rationale, with ample supporting evidence
from the mathematics education literature, that
symbolically stated problems are more direct and less
confusing than structurally equivalent verbal "story
problems."</p>

<p>11 In contrast, with the alternative perspective, the
data from the present example are recast into the 2 ×
1 table in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table3">Table 3</a>, based on just the
<i>N'</i> = 64 students who exhibited a difference in
mastery for the two problem formats. With
<i>O</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>n</i><sub>12</sub> = 31,
<i>O</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>n</i><sub>21</sub> = 33, and
<nobr><i>E</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> = (31 +
33)/2 = 32</nobr>, <nobr><img align="middle" src="./levin_8_2_files/chisq.gif"> = [(31 - 32)<sup>2</sup>/32] + [(33 -
32)<sup>2</sup>/32] = 0.03 + 0.03 = 0.06</nobr>, the same
value as before.  In addition, for the hypothesis
<nobr><i>H</i><sub>0</sub>: <i>p</i> = 0.5</nobr>, a focus
on <i>n</i><sub>12</sub>, with expected value <i>N'</i>/2
and variance <i>N'</i>/4, leads to the squared <i>z</i>
statistic, <nobr><img align="middle" src="./levin_8_2_files/chisq.gif"> =
[(<i>n</i><sub>12</sub> -
<i>N'</i>/2)<sup>2</sup>]/(<i>N'</i>/4)</nobr>.  This
latter formula easily converts to the conventional McNemar
formula, because <nobr><i>N'</i> = <i>n</i><sub>12</sub> +
<i>n</i><sub>21</sub></nobr>, <nobr><i>n</i><sub>12</sub> -
<i>N'</i>/2 = (<i>n</i><sub>12</sub> -
<i>n</i><sub>21</sub>)/2</nobr>, and the 2<sup>2</sup> and
4 cancel.</p>

<h2>2.4   Comment</h2>

<p>12 So what difference does it make which of these two
formulas and associated perspectives is adopted? 
Pedagogically, we strongly recommend the latter, primarily
because it: (1) maps directly onto students' previously
acquired binomial, chi-square contingency table, and
goodness-of-fit test concepts; (2) provides consistency and
continuity in extending the one-sample correlated
proportions test to additional applications (as is
demonstrated in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Section3"><nobr>Section
3</nobr></a>); and (3) can be directly related to other
similar statistical-test transformations that students will
ultimately encounter (as is noted in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Section4"><nobr>Section 4</nobr></a>).</p>

<h1>3.  Comparing Change in Two or More Populations</h1></a>

<p>13 It is not uncommon in repeated-measures studies with
dichotomous dependent variables for the researcher to
obtain data from two or more samples.  For example, one of
the samples could be a control group and the other(s)
treatment groups.  In such experiments, interest focuses on
the equality of the individual McNemar change parameters. 
Let <i>k</i> (<i>k</i> = 1, ..., <i>K</i>) denote an
individual's group, and let
<i>p</i><sub><i>i</i>·<i>k</i></sub> and
<i>p</i><sub>·<i>ik</i></sub> denote the marginal
probabilities of interest in the <i>k</i><sup>th</sup>
group.  If, in the <i>k</i><sup>th</sup> group, the
difference in corresponding marginal probabilities (the
change parameter) is denoted <img border="0" src="./levin_8_2_files/Delta.gif"><sub><i>ik</i></sub> =
<i>p</i><sub><i>i</i>·<i>k</i></sub> -
<i>p</i><sub>·<i>i</i><i>k</i></sub>, then the null
hypothesis of interest in the multiple-group design,
expressing the equality of the change parameters, is</p>

<center> 
<i>H</i><sub>0</sub>: <img border="0" src="./levin_8_2_files/Delta.gif"><sub><i>i</i>1</sub> =
··· = <img border="0" src="./levin_8_2_files/Delta.gif"><sub><i>iK</i></sub> 
</center> 


<h2>3.1  The Two-Sample Case</h2>

<p>14 In the two-sample case, (1) the number of observations
falling into each sample's change cells is unknown prior to
the experiment; and (2) in each of the populations from
which the samples came, the extent to which the change
parameter differs from zero is given by the relative
probability of falling into one of the two change cells. 
Thus, comparing change parameters involves determining
whether the relative probability of falling into one of the
change cells is independent of group membership, when
neither of the margins is fixed.  That is, it involves a
test of independence, and the appropriate test is the
Fisher-Irwin (or "Fisher exact") test. </p>

<p>15 To illustrate the various tests for the two-sample
case, consider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table4">Table 4</a>, in which some
of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table2">Table 2</a> data are
re-presented.  Students taking the algebra test are also
asked to think back to the college entrance examination
that they took in high school and to indicate which of
their two subtest scores was higher, verbal or
quantitative.  Another intuitively interesting hypothesis
is that students' differences in mastery of the two problem
formats (verbal vs. symbolic) is related to students'
verbal vs. quantitative skill profiles.  Of the 186
students taking the algebra test, 105 reported higher
verbal than quantitative performance on their college
entrance examination, 63 reported higher quantitative than
verbal, and 18 either did not take such an examination or
could not remember their relative performances.  The joint
frequency data for the 168 students who could be classified
as either "higher verbal" or "higher quantitative" are
summarized in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table4">Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>16 Consistent with the alternative approach that was
discussed for the one-sample case, the change-cell data are
extracted and compiled into a separate 2
(verbal/quantitative profiles) × 2 (format
combinations) table -- see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table5">Table 5</a>.  The key here is to
recognize that only the two  change cells from each group
are material in assessing the hypothesis of comparable
change symmetry.  Because the margins for the newly
constructed <nobr>2 × 2</nobr> table are not fixed in
advance, one can test the comparable change hypothesis
using any procedure that is appropriate for an independence
chi-square model (or, in the present two-sample case, a
<i>z</i> test of the equality of two proportions).  As was
noted earlier, when that table is associated with
relatively small expected cell frequencies, the appropriate
statistical test is the Fisher exact test.  To perform that
test, all possible tables with the observed marginal
frequencies must be generated.  Then for each table with a
change disparity at least as extreme as that in the
observed table, one must calculate the corresponding
hypergeometric probability.  As a measure of change
disparity, one can use the difference in the sample
proportions, the sample phi coefficient, or the sample
Pearson chi-square statistic, all of which are
algebraically related in a one-to-one fashion.</p>

<p>17 Alternatively, with large expected "change" cell
frequencies, the traditional Pearson chi-square test of
independence may be used as a convenient approximation. 
Additional large-sample approximate procedures include the
likelihood ratio <img align="middle" src="./levin_8_2_files/chisq.gif"> test,
a test based on multinomial proportions (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#marascuilo79">Marascuilo and Serlin 1979</a>), a
test using log-odds ratios (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#marascuilo88">Marascuilo and Serlin 1988</a>, pp.
710-713), and the test of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#bishop">Bishop,
Fienberg, and Holland (1975)</a>.  For the data in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table5"><nobr>Table 5</nobr></a>, with their
sufficiently large expected "change" cell frequencies (all
are found to be greater than 5), the one-degree-of-freedom
Pearson <img align="middle" src="./levin_8_2_files/chisq.gif">  (based on the
familiar <nobr><i>O</i> - <i>E</i></nobr> formula) is equal
to 8.18, with an associated significance probability of
.004.  Based on a Type I error probability of .05 and with
reference to the actual data, this indicates that
problem-format mastery is related to students' skill
profiles, in the expected direction:  for higher verbal
scorers, 55/105 (52%) mastered the verbally presented
problems, in contrast to 47/105 (45%) who mastered the
symbolically presented problems, for a verbal-symbolic
difference of 7%; whereas for higher quantitative scorers,
the respective values are 43/63 (68%) and 55/63 (87%), for
a verbal-symbolic difference of -19%. The difference in
these two differences, which is what the two-sample McNemar
test is testing, is 26%.</p>

<h2>3.2  More Than Two Samples</h2>

<p>18 Extension to the <i>K</i> &gt; 2 group situation is
straightforward, as we illustrate by extending  the present
example. It may be recalled that 18 students could not be
classified as scoring higher on either the verbal or
quantitative portion of their college entrance
examination.  With these students included as an "unknown"
third category, the frequency outcomes are summarized in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table6">Table 6</a> (complete data) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table7">Table 7</a> ("change" cells).</p>

<p>19 For the data in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#Table7">Table 7</a>, a
Pearson chi-square test of homogeneity yields  <img align="middle" src="./levin_8_2_files/chisq.gif"> = 12.88 based on 2 degrees
of freedom, with an associated significance probability of
.0016.  Because the expected cell frequencies associated
with the unknown category are less than 5, an extension of
the Fisher exact test was also conducted using the computer
program developed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#klotz">Klotz and Teng
(1975)</a> and yielded a significance probability of
.001.</p>

<p>20 Familywise <img src="./levin_8_2_files/alpha.gif">-controlled planned
post-omnibus between-group statistical comparisons of
proportions (e.g., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#marascuilo88">Marascuilo and
Serlin 1988</a>) can be conducted in the
two-degree-of-freedom situation with the Fisher LSD
procedure (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#levin94">Levin, Serlin, and Seaman
1994</a>), as applied to either <i>z</i> or chi-square
statistics or to Fisher exact comparisons, depending on
sample size.  For the present three-group example, Fisher's
LSD procedure combined with Fisher exact comparisons (based
on a familywise <img src="./levin_8_2_files/alpha.gif"> of .05) indicate that
there is a difference in the problem-format outcomes of
higher quantitative students (symbolic format = 55/63
students, or 87%; verbal format = 43/63, or 68%, for a
symbolic-verbal difference of 19%) and both higher verbal
students, as in the two-sample case (47/105 = 45% and
55/105 = 52%, respectively, difference = -7%) and unknown
students (3/18 = 17% and 9/18 = 50%, respectively,
difference = -33%).  </p>

<p>21 As an interpretive comment, students in the statistics
course are alerted to the possibility that numerous
demographic and experiential factors in addition to (or
other than) the posited mathematics anxiety or relative
verbal and quantitative skills could readily contribute to
the results, including those related to students' native
language, gender, and the like.  For example, foreign
students in the class may have had a more difficult time
comprehending or interpreting the verbally stated questions
than the symbolically stated ones simply because of their
English language limitations.</p>

<p>22 For more than two-degree-of-freedom situations, other
familywise <img src="./levin_8_2_files/alpha.gif">-controlled
multiple-comparison procedures may be employed (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#levin94">Levin et al. 1994</a>).  In addition, (1)
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#klotz">Klotz and Teng's (1975)</a> program can be
used to perform exact tests of planned or post hoc, simple
or complex, contrasts among the change-cell proportions;
and (2) when applied to specified contrasts, the approach
introduced here also permits straightforward investigation
of main effects and interactions in multiple-factor
contingency tables.</p>

<a name="Section4">
<h1>4.  Summary</h1></a>

<p>23 In this note we have introduced a
comprehension-enhancing alternative perspective for the
McNemar test of change -- or, more precisely, the
multinomial test of correlated proportions.  The present
perspective allows for direct extensions to two or more
samples in which questions of comparable marginal outcome
probabilities are of interest.  Of additional note is that
the present McNemar simplification maps directly onto
analogous ones that students can be taught in the context
of one-, two-, and <i>K</i>-sample tests of correlated
means based on <i>t</i> and <i>F</i> distributions.
Comparing two or more different treatments in terms of
pretest-posttest differences, as a simplification of the
<i>K</i> × 2 split-plot ANOVA treatment by time
interaction, is but one example of such mapping (e.g., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063913/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/levin.cfm#levin77">Levin and Marascuilo 1977</a>).  Indeed,
one-sample, two-sample, and three-sample correlated
<i>t</i> and <i>F</i> tests applied to students' actual
verbal and symbolic test scores in the present example
(rather than dichotomized "mastery" outcomes) produced
statistical conclusions consistent with those already
discussed.</p>
