"Use of Spreadsheets for
Demonstrating Experimental Power and Variability,"</a>
<cite>Journal of Statistics Education</cite>, 7(1).</h3></p>


<p>The second paragraph of Section 2, "Spreadsheet for the
Power of the Two-Sample t-Test," requires clarification. 
Power can be illustrated through simulation, but in a
completely different way than is illustrated here.  In
fact, the simulation in Figure 1 carries out a simulated
experiment once.  The fact that one "can do another
experiment by pressing the F9 key" doesn't help at all to
clarify the concept of the power of a test; a "long run"
property should be demonstrated.</p>

<p>The p-value in the spreadsheet in Figure 1 (in fact, the
only result in boldface) is inappropriate, because p-values
relate to the level of significance, whereas the intention
of the paper is to demonstrate power.  When the "Truth" is
as given in Figure 1 (and, in fact, the main point of the
simulation is that the reader should play with situations
where the control mean differs from the treated mean), then
the t-statistic follows a noncentral t-distribution.  Excel
computes probabilities for the usual (central)
t-distribution and produces p-values on the basis of that
computation.</p>

<p>The picture with separate confidence intervals for
Treated and Control doesn't tell much in a context where
comparison is the research question.  What does the reader
learn from seeing overlapping confidence intervals (apart
from the fact that the level of confidence isn't even
mentioned)?  Can treatment effects then be attributed to
chance alone?  Here is a numerical example.  Take 16
controls with mean 59.2 and 9 treated animals with mean
70.7.  Let the pooled standard deviation equal 12.  Under
the assumptions of the paper, the 95% confidence intervals
for the mean effects of the treated and control groups
overlap.  But a 95% confidence interval for the difference
between the two population means does not contain zero!</p>

<p><h3>Response</h3></p>


<p>Professor Callaert suggests that my description of an
Excel spreadsheet for demonstrating experimental power
requires  clarification. I am happy to attempt this.</p>

<p>He states that power can be illustrated through
simulation in a  different way. No doubt this is so; there
must be many ways to do  it. I have found that my
spreadsheet does help to explain  a key point in
understanding experimental power: that p-values are subject
to experimental variability, and that they depend on the
truth and the sample size. The calculation of the power is
then done otherwise, by tables or PC packages such as
Minitab-12, and this is illustrated in class. The
spreadsheet is not intended  to be used for such
calculations, not even approximately.</p>

<p>The picture used, with separate confidence intervals for
Treated and Control, mimics what is normally done in the
scientific literature that my audience will read and
publish in. (This may be because there are often more than
two groups to compare.) It is true that these  intervals
may overlap, and yet the difference be significant at 5%.
It is something I sometimes draw their attention to; many
are not aware of this possibility. I agree that the level
of confidence  (which is 95%) should be stated, and I have
amended the spreadsheet accordingly.</p>
