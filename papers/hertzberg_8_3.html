<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Unlike primary and secondary educators, professors in
post-secondary education are not required to meet
certification requirements in education. Expressly, they
are not required to have demonstrated competencies in the
areas of education that contribute to the process of
educating undergraduate and graduate students, such as
pedagogy or evaluation in a subject matter area. To address
its responsibility for training graduate students as
teachers as well as scholars and investigators, the Emory
University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences implemented
the Teaching Assistant and Teacher Training Opportunity
(TATTO) for all graduate students in 1992. Each graduate
department has instituted its own TATTO program with a
consistent and Graduate School-approved format. In this
paper we describe our experience over the last six years
with the evolving teacher-training program in the
Department of Biostatistics. In our program, we focus on
developing communication skills for all graduates, even
those who may not pursue an academic career involving
teaching. We also discuss the merits and challenges of our
course in pedagogy in biostatistics, as well as other
training components, including instruction in statistical
consultation.  We have found that the interactive dynamic
nature of this program is well-received by the students. 
We have also found that the students benefit from 
observing good teachers, with attention to the craft of
teaching, and from the feedback given by these teachers on
student teaching style.</p>


<h1>1. Introduction</h1>


<p>1 Although hundreds of papers have been written in the
area of statistics education, many of these expositions
focus on a particular technique for instruction in a given
method or area. Relatively few authors have written on
statistical or biostatistical pedagogy in a comprehensive
manner (see, for instance, 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063858/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n3/hertzberg.cfm#Khamis">Khamis 1991</a>;

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063858/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n3/hertzberg.cfm#Dawson">Dawson-Saunders, Azen, Greenberg, and
Reed 1987</a>). 
Although the papers cited above deal more
generally with effective teaching in introductory
statistics courses, there is a dearth of material available
on preparation of future statistics teachers at the
undergraduate or graduate level.  A web search of curricula
in graduate programs in statistics and biostatistics
revealed four programs that offer formal instruction in
pedagogy in the discipline, and, of these, two appear to be
giving course credit for the teaching assistantship.</p>

<p>2 The Teaching Assistant and Teacher Training Opportunity
(TATTO) program was initiated at Emory University in the
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1992. The goal of
this program is to prepare graduate students for careers in
the professoriate as scholars and investigators, instilling
in them the knowledge, competence, and confidence for
success in their first academic positions. One of the
fundamental premises of the TATTO program is that teaching
and research are complementary, rather than conflicting,
activities. Another premise is that students will benefit
from the course by improving communication skills,
regardless of the students' career goals. Hence, a primary
goal of this program is the balancing of scholarly
preparation with a thorough and thoughtful preparation of
each student in the arts of pedagogy.</p>

<p>3 The Emory TATTO program is marked by two distinguishing
characteristics. First, all students pursuing the Ph.D. are
required to complete the program as part of their academic
requirements. Second, the TATTO program is divided into
stages, with each stage leading to increased independence
in the classroom. These stages are  a four day Summer
Course covering topics of general interest to all graduate
students regardless of discipline, a discipline-specific
course on pedagogy in each academic department, the
Teaching Assistantship, and the Teaching Associateship.</p>

<p>4 In this paper we summarize the summer course and
describe our experience over the last six years in
developing the teacher-training program in the Department
of Biostatistics. In particular, we focus on the pedagogy
course in biostatistics as well as the variation that we
have implemented on the Teaching Associateship,
specifically incorporating closely supervised
biostatistical consultation experiences into this
program.</p>


<h1>2. The Summer Course</h1>


<p>5 During the week prior to fall semester orientation,
approximately 300 students from the 20 graduate departments
gather to discuss important issues related to teaching at
Emory and at other colleges and universities. This course
is led by faculty drawn from the best teachers across the
institution.</p>

<p>6 Students for the course comprise those serving as
teaching assistants for the first time in the fall
semester. Generally they are in their second year of
graduate study at Emory. Students who have not completed
the summer course may not serve as teaching assistants.
International students must be evaluated in English as a
Second Language, including classes in pronunciation and
writing, prior to their participation in the summer
course.</p>

<p>7 The course covers a variety of topics, including
Lecturing, Writing as a Pedagogical Tool, Use of New
Technologies, Voice &amp; Body, Diversity in the Classroom,
Syllabi &amp; Grading, Teaching Using Discussion, Conduct
of Lab Sessions, Campus Resources, Ethics, and Fostering an
Environment for Learning. These topics are covered in two
formats, plenary sessions and workshops. The capstone
experience of the course is the micro-teaching session. In
this session of ten to twelve students, led by a faculty
member, each student presents a mini-class before his or
her peers, who then offer a critique of the teaching
performance.</p>


<h1>3.  Pedagogy Instruction: How to Teach Biostatistics
</h1>

<p>8 The course on pedagogy, How to Teach Biostatistics, is
offered each fall semester. The content addresses the
problems and issues involved in teaching biostatistics
courses, focusing on introductory classes.  Two semester
hours of credit are received for this course.  Each session
of the course has three components: an open forum to
discuss issues that arise in the course of teaching
assistant (TA) duties, a discussion of the week's topic,
chosen for its relevance in teaching introductory
biostatistics courses, and mini-teaching.</p>

<p>9 The open forum is usually the first component of each
week's session. Students are encouraged to raise issues
that arise in the course of their first semester as
teaching assistants. All students are encouraged to
participate in the ensuing discussion, to try to resolve
problems and to identify solutions. Examples of issues that
arise for discussion include how to deal with students who
monopolize the TA's time in the help sessions, TA's not
knowing the answer to a question, and students who need
help with course prerequisites (e.g., algebra or math).
Occasionally these sessions leave the confines of the
particular course and move into the realm of departmental
and university policy and politics. Examples of issues that
arise for discussion in these sessions include
discrimination or harassment based on race or sex,
cheating, and copying homework. According to the written
comments on the course evaluations, the students
particularly enjoy this aspect of the course. They like the
opportunity to discuss issues, as well as to touch base and
review their previous week as a TA. They appreciate the
flexibility that this gives them to take the class in a
direction that they need.</p>


<p>10 The course topics for discussion are listed in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063858/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n3/hertzberg.cfm#Table1">Table 1</a>. The textbook and other
reference material used are listed in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063858/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n3/hertzberg.cfm#Table2">Table 2</a>. As part of the introductory
material, students are introduced formally to concepts
relevant to designing a new course, for example, the Bloom
taxonomy for educational objectives (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063858/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n3/hertzberg.cfm#Bloom">Bloom, Engelhart, Furst, Hill, and Krathwohl
1956</a>). Homework assignments are also given. Students
are expected to read the assigned material from the
textbook and other papers prior to a given session. 
Assignments include writing course objectives for some of
the departmental service courses and developing syllabi for
these courses. As the course progresses, topics become
subsequently more and then less focussed on the issues
faced in teaching biostatistics courses.</p>

<p>11 The third component of the course is mini-teaching.
Each student is expected to prepare a brief (20-minute)
presentation to the group on a topic that s/he would
include in an introductory biostatistics course. These
presentations are videotaped. After the presentation,
constructive feedback is given. Over time we have found
that it is not useful to replay every video for the entire
class; rather, each student is obliged to view his or her
own video immediately after class dismissal. The students
receive their videos so that they can view them
subsequently at their leisure. The students have remarked
positively on course evaluations that they like preparing
the presentations as well as seeing how other students
organize and deliver their presentations. However, the
students perceive additional stress from the presence of
the video camera. This stress has been alleviated somewhat
in recent years since we no longer routinely replay the
tapes in class.</p>

<p>12 Student course evaluations are taken very seriously,
and this course has benefited greatly from changes
implemented in response to student feedback. Our current
challenge is to incorporate sessions on new technology into
the course, which is limited by availability of
equipment.</p>

<p>13 Although only the second year doctoral students are
required to take this course for academic credit, over the
years we have found that there are other professionals new
to the department who have benefited by sitting in on the
course as well. In particular, post-doctoral fellows and
new faculty have found selected sessions useful in
preparing for their first excursions as teachers.</p>


<h1>4.  The Teaching Associateship: Instruction in
Statistical Consultation </h1>

<p>14 In most other graduate departments at Emory, the
required teaching associateship experience is fulfilled by
co-teaching a course with a faculty member. We have
modified this for our department. The final step of the
TATTO program in biostatistics is satisfied through
studying and participating in statistical consulting
activities, a major part of the work of almost every
biostatistician. Statistical consulting is viewed as an
activity that includes explaining biostatistical concepts
and methods to professionals from other biomedical and
health-related fields. Our departmental philosophy is that
it is not sufficient that students learn when and how to
apply various statistical methods in order to become
effective consultants. Rather, students must learn how to
communicate with different clients, such as physicians,
investigators, and students from other disciplines, many of
whom have had very little training in biostatistics.
Therefore, the development of good oral and written
communication skills is essential for a biostatistical
consultant. Moreover, we do not offer undergraduate classes
in biostatistics. Thus, there is limited opportunity for
co-teaching, unlike many other departments at Emory that
have TATTO.</p>

<p>15 In order to satisfy the consulting requirements,
students enroll in the required biostatistical consulting
course, taught by faculty of the Biostatistical Consulting
Center. This course explores the roles, responsibilities,
and other issues related to the biostatistician as
consultant or collaborator in the biomedical field. This
consulting course has evolved over the years from a more
traditional format of slowly integrating students into the
consulting process to one of immersion and discussion of
relevant consulting topics.</p>

<p>16 Formerly, the course was structured in two parts. The
first part of the course was dedicated to preparing
students to act as consultants through discussions of
consulting models, interpersonal communication, ethics,
common client types, time and financial management, and
other issues. In the second part of the course,  students
gained experience by participating in the consulting
process. Initially under supervision of a faculty member,
students collaborated with researchers to develop the
design and/or the analysis of quantitative investigations.
With experience, the collaboration between student and
researcher was carried out more independently and
subsequently reviewed and critiqued by faculty and
students. Students then discussed their consulting
experiences during class meetings, and they prepared a
final report to serve as both a class project and a summary
of their work for the researcher.</p>

<p>17 The main problem with the above approach to teaching
statistical consulting is that most students enter the
class with so little consulting experience that they have a
difficult time appreciating or relating to the concepts in
the first half of the course. Thus, an alternative approach
has been adopted in which students are required to act as
consultants at the beginning of the course. This immersion
into the consulting process is done by bringing in mock
clients, usually faculty or staff members from the
Department of Biostatistics, with consulting problems.  In
the classroom, a pair of students conducts the mock
consulting session while other students and the instructor
observe. The mock clients bring in contrived problems that
focus the students' learning on particular discussion
topics such as consulting models, ethics, or common client
types. In addition, there are required reading assignments
emphasizing a topic prior to the classroom session, many of
which come from the text of James Boen and Douglas Zahn (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063858/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n3/hertzberg.cfm#Boen">Boen and Zahn 1982</a>). After a mock
consulting session, the instructor and students engage in a
critique and discussion of the session, and the learning
points from the primary discussion topic are highlighted.
Usually one mock consulting session and discussion require
a 90-minute class session. Repeating these mock consulting
sessions using a variety of topics and all of the students
appears to better educate and prepare the students for
their real consulting with external researchers in a later
component of this course. The ensuing discussions
incorporate the topics covered by Derr in the context of
communications (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063858/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n3/hertzberg.cfm#Derr">Derr 2000</a>). Topics
covered in this course are found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063858/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n3/hertzberg.cfm#Table3">Table

<h1>5.  Future Directions</h1>

<p>18 Response to this program has been very positive. 
Students often cite the TATTO program as a positive
factor influencing their decision to matriculate at Emory. 
Faculty have received warm responses in describing this
program to other statistics educators.  Since our annual
cohorts of students are small in number, averaging four or
five per year, there have been very few students who have
graduated from the program and entered the academic job
market from whom we can gather follow-up data.</p>

<p>19 We continue to fine tune the program to respond to
course evaluations as well as to the evolution of
statistics education.  In the Fall 1999 pedagogy course,
we changed the syllabus dramatically to include sessions
regarding use of instructional technology and distance
learning techniques. These topics will continue to be
included in future offerings.  The consulting course has
recently changed its text to emphasize development of
communications skills.</p>

<p>20 Implementation of this type of program in other
doctoral programs in statistics or biostatistics could be
readily accomplished.  It requires relatively modest
investments in video equipment, as well as dedicated
faculty.  More importantly, however, it requires the
organizational will to allot a modest amount of doctoral
study to an area of less technical skills. Thus, such a
commitment is possible only when there is buy-in from high
levels of administration, from department chair to graduate
dean to provost.</p>

<p>21 This program has allowed Emory University to
demonstrate a commitment to the development of scholarly
excellence through pedagogical development.  The Department
of Biostatistics at Emory University is leading the way in
developing the next generation of biostatistics
educators.</p>
