<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Both teaching and learning are  increasingly becoming
technology-oriented processes, and teachers are struggling 
to keep up with rapid technological advances. The Internet,
one of the most popular  media of communication, provides
fast access to  vast amounts of information. There are many
web  sites that contain information useful for Advanced
Placement Statistics teachers. This paper provides
information about Internet resources available for project
ideas,  datasets, conferences, technical support, class
notes, and much more.</p>

<h1>1. Introduction </h1>

<p>There is a tremendous amount of information available on
the World Wide Web  for teachers of Advanced Placement (AP)
Statistics. With some initial guidance,  teachers can
incorporate the power of the Internet to access
information  immediately throughout the world and increase
efficiency in their delivery of  instruction. Many schools
now have Internet connections and some kind of  computers
available for teachers and students, and more schools are
getting  wired for access every day. Technology-oriented
classrooms expand the boundaries of the traditional
classroom. Through the use of the Internet, teachers are
able  to reach both traditional and non-traditional
students. In many schools only one  or two teachers are in
charge of teaching statistics courses. Many teachers whose 
training and experience is in teaching mathematics courses 
may feel isolated  and inadequate when teaching courses in
statistics. The Internet has brought the  world closer, and
several resources are easily available to teachers.</p>

<p>Teachers experience different needs in the classroom and
outside the  classroom. Internet resources can be used
inside the classroom to supplement  lecture, provide
motivation, and ease computations. Outside the classroom,
such  resources can be used to prepare lectures, homework
assignments, and handouts, as  well as to perform
computations. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/mulekar.cfm#Kabacoff">Kabacoff (1995)</a> says
that the Internet provides a platform  for the development
of teaching tools that are visual, interactive, 
user-friendly, and inherently accessible to students. He
also describes the  principles involved in creating such
tools and illustrates them through the  development of a
statistical calculator that is designed to assist in the 
evaluation of diagnostic screening tests.</p>

<p>Here I have tried to group resources into different
categories based on their  purpose. Although not listed
here repeatedly, many web  sites contain information that
can be classified into more than one category. I  have
listed many web sites that I have used in a
non-calculus-based introductory  statistics course that I
teach, as well as a few that were recommended to me by 
other statistics teachers. This is an attempt to uncover
the tip of an iceberg.  By no means is it a complete
listing of available resources. All omissions  are
unintentional.  This is an attempt to give teachers a good
start, initial  direction, and some confidence in setting
out on a journey in this wonderful but (to some) 
unfamiliar maze of the Internet.</p>

<h1>2. Internet Resources </h1>

<p>For those who are not familiar with different modes of
information transfer,  search, and access, there is a
comprehensive online training program made  available by
the National Cable Television Association at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.webteacher.org/">http://www.webteacher.org/</a>. 
This program is designed to provide educators with tools
they need to incorporate many new  education technologies
into their lesson plans. It is very useful for getting 
information about tools such as telnet, ftp, newsgroups,
mail lists, image  files, and html. A primer and a tutorial
are also available at this site.</p>

<p>The resources to be discussed are grouped into the
following broad categories: </p>

<p>Note that many web sites are interlinked, providing more
than one avenue to  access the site of interest.  Also note
that web addresses, the contents of web sites, and the
organization of web sites tend to change from time to
time.  Most of the links in this paper take the reader
outside the <cite>Journal of Statistics Education</cite>,
and neither the author nor the journal have any control
over the content or the permanency of those sites.  If
links in this paper fail, please use the information
provided and a search engine to locate new addresses for
the sites. Now let us consider these categories one at a
time.</p>

<ul>
<p></p><li><a name="APStatistics">Advanced Placement Statistics course and test:</a><br>

A major source of  information about the AP Statistics
course is the College Board site at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.collegeboard.org/">http://www.collegeboard.org/</a> <cite>(College Board Online)</cite>.
This  site provides information about the course, syllabus,
recommended textbooks,  past tests, future test schedules,
questions from past tests, rubrics for past  tests, grading
scale, and sites and times of summer workshops. To any
teacher planning to teach AP Statistics,  this site
provides valuable information and should be the first site
visited  before making any plans for the course. Once at
this site, use the search  engine to go to AP
Statistics-related materials. <p></p>

<p></p></li><li><a name="Teaching">Teaching the introductory statistics course</a><p></p>
 
<ul>

  
<p></p><li><a name="Sample">Sample syllabi and exams:</a> <br>Many teachers of AP
    Statistics courses  maintain web sites to share  with
    others information from the courses they have
    developed. Also sites are available from teachers of 
    introductory statistics courses at colleges and
    universities that are  similar to the AP course in
    curriculum coverage. These sites provide good resources
    for  teachers until they feel confident enough to
    develop their own materials. A  few examples
    follow.<p></p>

     
<ul>

<li>A web site by Albert Coon at Buckingham Brown &amp;
Nichols School  (BB&amp;N) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.bbns.org/us/math/ap_stats">http://www.bbns.org/us/math/ap_stats</a>) 
has information for AP Statistics teachers and links to
other useful  sites. 

</li><li>A web site by Paul Myers at Woodward Academy (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.woodward.edu/faculty/us/math/apstat/">http://www.woodward.edu/faculty/us/math/apstat/</a>) 
      has a good collection of AP Statistics resources and
      provides many links  to the College Board, calculator
      resources (TI-82, 85, 83 tips), computer  resources,
      textbooks, journals, newsletters, and discussions. 

</li><li>Allan Rossman at Dickinson College maintains a web site
      at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.dickinson.edu/~rossman/ws/">http://www.dickinson.edu/~rossman/ws/</a>. 
      Although this is not an AP Statistics site, there is
      plenty of information  useful for AP Statistics
      teachers. It gives datasets, sample exams, and
      in-class activities. 

</li><li>A web site by Joshua Zucker of Gunn High School, Palo
Alto, CA (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.gunn.palo-alto.ca.us/teacher/jzucker/">http://www.gunn.palo-alto.ca.us/teacher/jzucker/</a>) 
provides a list of topics that students can research and
present to the  class. It also provides a few comments
about what is expected from  students in their reports and
oral discussions.  </li></ul>


<p></p></li><li><a name="Activities">Activities</a><p></p>

    <ul>

<li>Many activities can be developed using M&amp;M's
      candies. These are  very popular among teachers and
      students. The M&amp;M web site at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.m-ms.com/">http://www.m-ms.com/</a> 
      provides lots of information including proportions of
      different colors in  different types of candies,
      useful for developing activities for  descriptive
      statistics, the central limit theorem, confidence
      intervals, and  tests of hypotheses. 

</li><li>Allan Rossman's web site at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.dickinson.edu/~rossman/ws/">http://www.dickinson.edu/~rossman/ws/</a> 
      lists several in-class activities. 

</li><li>The education program of the National  Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://education.nasa.gov/">http://education.nasa.gov/</a>
gives  links and resources for educators as well as
students. Several activities for students are also
available. This is a very big web site, and beginners  can
easily get lost here. This site has information for
teachers of not  only statistics but also other subjects.
Due to the volume of information made available by
different NASA sites for educational  purposes, it is not
possible to give more specific addresses.  There  is so
much information available for teachers and students at
many NASA  sites that one can easily devote an entire 
paper to specific addresses of NASA projects. </li></ul>

<p> </p></li><li><a name="discussion">Statistical discussion groups:</a> <br>

Teachers of AP  Statistics do not have to feel isolated.
    Help is available only a few  keystrokes away.
    Statistical discussion groups are available online and
    are  frequently visited by well-known statisticians
    always willing to help. Just  visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://forum.swarthmore.edu/epigone/sci.stat.math">http://forum.swarthmore.edu/epigone/sci.stat.math</a> 
    and read what others are discussing. Start a discussion
    if you need help with a statistical concept, teaching
    technique, analysis technique, or technology need by
    posting a message, or contribute to the ongoing 
    discussion by giving your own opinion. Past discussions
    dated back to June  1996 are listed here by topic and
    can be viewed any time. A search mechanism is also
    available for searching by topic or month and year.<p></p>

<p>A group called Isolated Teachers of Statistics
  (ISOSTATS) meets at  Joint Mathematics Meetings and Joint
  Statistical Meetings and plans to  do some networking. It
  consists primarily of statisticians who are in
  mathematics  departments. For more information, contact
  Dex Whittinghill from Rowan  University at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/mailto:Whittinghill@rowan.edu">Whittinghill@rowan.edu</a>.
  There is  another group called ISOTEASTATS, which
  consists of mathematicians who teach  statistics.</p>

  
<p> </p></li><li><a name="Reference">Reference books:</a><br>
    
    Several reference books are  available
    online. They may not have been written specifically for
    the AP  Statistics course, but they provide useful
    reference material for teachers who want to  brush up
    on their content knowledge or as supplementary material
    for students to use outside the classroom. <p></p>

    
<ul>

<li>StatSoft (developer of Statistica) has an electronic
      textbook online  at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/stathome.html">http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/stathome.html</a>. 
      It is not suitable as a textbook for an AP Statistics
      course, but it is  useful as a quick reference
      without a trip to the library. It contains a  lot
      more information than is needed in an AP Statistics
      course. 

</li><li>"HyperStat," an introductory level hypertext
      statistics book by David  Lane at Rice University is
      available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.davidmlane.com/hyperstat/index.html">http://www.davidmlane.com/hyperstat/index.html</a>. 


 </li><li>"Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics"
by Kyle Siegrist  of the Department of Mathematical
Sciences at the University of Alabama at  Huntsville is
available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/">http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/</a>. 
This project provides a web-based textbook with interactive
modules,  mathematical theory behind statistical
procedures, examples, and exercises  as in a conventional
textbook. The notation used is more mathematical than 
statistical for use in an introductory statistics course. 
</li></ul>

      
<p></p></li><li><a name="Datasets">Datasets:</a><br>

Analyzing data is a useful and essential part of  learning
    statistical techniques and their applications. But as
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/mulekar.cfm#Ruxton">Ruxton (1996)</a>  describes, typing
    in large amounts of data can be a bit of a drag. Using
    the  vast amount of data available on the Internet can
    minimize the time spent on  typing in  datasets.
    Projects, surveys, and project reports at the web
    sites  of NASA (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://education.nasa.gov/">http://education.nasa.gov/</a>),

    other government  agencies provide lots of information
    that can be downloaded easily into  spreadsheets or
    statistical packages for analysis. <p></p>

      there are several education-related datasets
      including SAT scores,  reading test scores, AAUP
      faculty salaries, and test times in Minitab  files.
      Descriptions of datasets are also available.
      Additionally, datasets about baseball, county taxes,

      a search mechanism is available for search by word or
      subject. My search  for the word "statistics"
      resulted in 32 sites containing lots of data, 
      information, and publications on topics ranging from
      Education, Taxes, HIV  and AIDS Prevention,
      Earthquakes of the World, and Social and Economic

  program called  "DST express" is available for free
  download. Click on "Free Software."  This software
  enables one to easily find <i>p</i> or <i>x</i> for a

  gives a randomization plan, where a random assignment of
  experimental  units to treatments can be obtained. The
  idea is good, but it needs to be  accompanied by some
  information about the terminology used. Although 
  statistics is used by almost all disciplines, the
  terminology used tends to  differ among different
  disciplines. This site also provides the teacher  with
  notes called "The Little Handbook of Statistical
  Practice."  

</li><li>A web site maintained by the Statistics Department at

  This site provides a SASculator that can run SAS code and
  links to online SAS guides. It also provides calculators
  to compute the correlation coefficient, regression
  lines,  required sample sizes, box plots, histograms, and
  probabilities under  different densities.  

</li><li>The Department of Statistics at the University of South

  through the G.A.S.P. (Globally Accessible Statistical
  Procedures) initiative. Here  data analysis procedures
  are available in the form of Java applets.  Results are
  returned to the user's browser window or a Java applet
  window.  The procedures include the exact power of
  Fisher's exact test, visualization of three-dimensional
  data, and exact tests for <nobr>2 × 2</nobr>
  tables.

  are developed and made available by the Department of
  Statistics at Iowa  State University. A number of
  instructional modules designed to illustrate  concepts,
  provide important insights, and lead to meaningful 
  experiences and assignments with real or realistic
  problems of data analysis and inference are available.
  They are available to download via  anonymous ftp. The
  site also contains "Lessons of Teach modules" useful for 
  teachers who wish to incorporate modules into their
  courses. 

</li><li>"Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics"
  by Kyle Siegrist  of the Department of Mathematical
  Sciences at the University of Alabama at  Huntsville is
  accessible at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/">http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/</a>. 
  This project provides web-based interactive modules for
  students and  teachers of probability and statistics. The
  project is divided into  chapters similar to a book. Each
  chapter is divided into web pages similar  to sections of
  a book. The text guides students through the
  development  of mathematical theory. Most pages have
  links to Java applets that let  students run random
  experiments or generate data. Many pages are linked  to
  datasets from real statistical studies. It looks like a
  textbook on  the web with exercises. It is more
  mathematical than most introductory  statistics courses,
  but it is a good resource for teachers.  

</li><li>Visit "StatVillage" at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064013/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v5n2/schwarz.html">http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v5n2/schwarz.html</a>. 
  This is a very novel idea developed by Carl Schwarz at
  Simon Fraser  University. StatVillage is a hypothetical
  village in Canada. Homes in  this village are laid out in
  a system of blocks. Households can be  selected for a
  survey using a clickable map. Three versions of the
  village  are available. The results of a survey are
  returned to the user's web  browser. Many different
  variables are measured on each household. The data 
  returned are real, taken from the 1991 Census of Canada.
  The web address leads to a publication in the
  <cite>Journal of Statistics Education</cite>,  which
  gives more information about the StatVillage; one can
  follow a  link from the paper to the StatVillage itself.

<h1>3. Conclusions </h1>

<p>There is a lot more information available on the
Internet than  is possible to list in one paper, and more
is becoming  available every day. With this information, it
is hoped that teachers will get a  good start in the right
direction, and then they will be able to explore more 
resources on their own.</p>
