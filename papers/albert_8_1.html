<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This article describes the evaluation of the teaching
of statistical inference in a first statistics class.  A
sample survey project is described as a means of assessing
the effectiveness of a Bayesian approach in communicating
the basis tenets of inference.  There are several
advantages of the Bayes viewpoint in performing this survey
project, including the explicit modeling of one's prior
opinion by means of a probability distribution and the
relative ease in reporting statistical conclusions.  Some
evidence is presented to show that students with sufficient
knowledge can accurately specify probability distributions.
The success of the survey project is evaluated,  and
changes to the structure of the project are described that
facilitate the interaction of the instructor with the
students.</p>


<h1>1. Introduction</h1>


<h2> 1.1 An Introductory Statistics Class </h2>

<p>1 This article focuses on the introduction of
statistical inference from a Bayesian perspective and the
evaluation of this teaching of inference in the
college-level one-semester introductory statistics class. 
This particular class at Bowling Green State University is
taught to satisfy the mathematics elective requirement for
students majoring in the liberal arts. The course is also
taken as a recommended course by students  in other
colleges, such as the College of Health and Human
Resources. For most of the students, this is the only
course in statistics that they will take.  For this
audience, the class is designed to introduce the students
to the use of statistical reasoning in the real world.  The
goals of this course are well stated by the participants
of  a recent workshop on statistical education (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#hogg">Hogg 1992</a>, p. 8):

</p><blockquote>
Our aim in a first course is to develop critical reasoning skills necessary to understand our quantitative world.  The focus of the course is the process of learning how to ask appropriate questions, how to collect data effectively, how to summarize and interpret that information, and how to understand the limitations of statistical inferences.  Statistical thinking is central to education.</blockquote>

<p>2 To achieve these general goals, the class focuses on
the topics of data analysis, the production of data through
designed experiments and sample surveys, and drawing
conclusions from data. In data analysis, basic methods are
presented for displaying and summarizing categorical and
measurement data on one or two variables. The data
collection part of the course introduces several good
methods of collecting data, such as the simple random
sample and the completely randomized designed
experiment.</p>


<h2>1.2 Statistical Inference:  What Do We Want Our
Students to Learn? </h2>

<p>3 In this "liberal arts" statistics class, it is not
necessary to teach particular inferential methods such as a
<i>t</i> test or an analysis of variance procedure. 
However, it is desirable to communicate some basic tenets
of statistical inference. It is important that the students
distinguish samples and their summaries (statistics) from
populations and their summaries (parameters).  Students
should be made aware of the inherent variability in data,
and that sample data provide an incomplete description of a
population.   The validity of any statistical procedure
rests on the assumptions of the underlying model. The data
that are collected may not be very informative if the
assumptions of the model are violated.  For example, there
is often little information contained in a nonrandom sample
chosen by convenience. If a good sampling process is used,
one gets more accurate information from a larger sample.
</p> 

<p>4 Students should be able to distinguish different types
of inference problems.  Estimation problems in which one
wishes to learn about the value of a parameter are
fundamentally different from testing problems in which one
has to make a decision about the parameter.  The student
should understand the correct interpretation of statistical
"confidence" which underlies interval estimation and tests
of hypotheses.</p>


<h2>1.3 A Bayesian Class Using Collaborative Learning </h2>

<p>5 The introductory statistics class  was taught from a
Bayesian viewpoint using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#rossman">Rossman and Albert (2000)</a>.  The
necessary probability background was presented for Bayes'
rule, including the subjective interpretation of
probability, the interpretation and summarization of
probability distributions, and an introduction to
conditional probability by means of a two-way probability
table. This particular course was activity-driven.  The
students worked on directed activities from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#rossman">Rossman and
Albert (2000)</a> in small groups during class.  The
instructor's role was primarily to  provide assistance to
particular students working on the activities during
class.  Occasionally the instructor in this class would
give short lectures on topics that were generally confusing
in the working of the activities.</p>


<h2>1.4 How Do We Assess Learning of Statistical Inference?</h2>

<p>6 If one wishes the students to understand the basic
tenets of statistical inference as described above, then it
is important to develop assessment methods that
specifically test the understanding of the basic concepts.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#hubbard">Hubbard (1997</a>) describes the
pitfalls of standard assessment procedures that mimic the
exercises in many elementary statistics texts.  Students
may memorize procedures for correctly solving questions of
different types without really understanding the underlying
statistical concepts.  Hubbard describes how one can
construct questions that  test understanding of concepts.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#garfield">Garfield (1994)</a> discusses the
importance of using assessment methods other than
traditional tests and quizzes.  These methods include
projects, portfolios, attitude surveys, written reports,
and open-ended questions. The goal of these alternative
assessment methods is to improve learning.  They can
provide information to students on how well they have
learned a particular topic and provide diagnostic
information to instructors about individual students'
understanding of new material.</p>

<p>7 A number of authors, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#fillebrown">Fillebrown (1994)</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#roberts">Roberts (1992)</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#sevin">Sevin (1995)</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#chance">Chance (1997)</a>, describe
the use of student-conducted projects in statistics
courses. Chance describes a student project as an
"authentic" assessment technique that obtains information
about students' understanding in contexts that reflect
realistic situations.  Specifically, Chance outlines the
goals of a student project.  The project gauges the
students' understanding of the entire statistical process
(formulation of questions, data collection, description,
and analysis), it judges the students' ability to interpret
statistical arguments and computer output, it assesses the
students' ability to work with others and communicate
results, and it increases their interest in
statistics.</p> 


<h2>1.5 Outline </h2>

<p>8 This article describes the use of a sample survey
project to assess the understanding of statistical
inference.  Section 2 outlines the Bayesian methodology
based on discrete priors that is used to learn about a
population proportion.  Section 3 discusses the
implementation of the project, including the written
assignment, the specification of priors, the implementation
of the Bayesian methodology, and the interpretation of the
interval estimation procedure.  In the evaluation of the
first year's class, several problems were noted in the
completed projects, and Section 3.4 describes changes to
the project design for the second year's class that
appeared to improve the quality of the final reports. 
Section 4 summarizes the benefits of the projects in
assessing the learning of statistical inference.</p>


<h1>2. A Bayesian Approach to Learning About a Proportion
</h1>

<p>9 The Bayesian approach to statistical inference is based
on the subjective notion of probability.  One is uncertain
about the value of a parameter <img width="13" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./albert_8_1_files/theta.gif" alt="$\theta$">,
 and one models this uncertainty by means of a subjective
probability distribution. This distribution reflects one's
personal opinion about the location of the parameter. This
probability distribution is called the prior because it
reflects a person's knowledge about the location of <img width="13" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./albert_8_1_files/theta.gif" alt="$\theta$">
 before or prior to collecting data.  Once a random sample is taken and data are observed, one's knowledge about the parameter will change.  The new probability distribution for <img width="13" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./albert_8_1_files/theta.gif" alt="$\theta$">,
called the posterior, is computed by use of a conditional probability computation called Bayes' rule.  All statistical inferences about the parameter are based on this probability distribution.  For example, a 95%
Bayesian interval estimate for <img width="13" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./albert_8_1_files/theta.gif" alt="$\theta$">
is an interval that contains 95% of the posterior probability distribution.</p>

<p>10 I describe the Bayesian methodology in the setting of
the sample survey project that will be discussed in Section
3. Suppose that a student is interested in the proportion
of undergraduate students <i>p</i> who smoke regularly. 
She takes a random sample of <i>n</i> students by a phone
survey and records the number <i>s</i> who smoke; let
<i>f</i> = <i>n</i> - <i>s</i> denote the number who don't
regularly smoke. She is interested in constructing a 95%
interval estimate for the population proportion
<i>p</i>.</p>

<p>11 A Bayesian interval estimate for the proportion
<i>p</i> can be constructed by use of a discrete prior
(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#berry">Berry 1995</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#albert">Albert 1995</a>).  Suppose that the  student can
specify a collection of plausible values of <i>p</i>, call
them  <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, ...,
<i>p</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>, with respective prior
probabilities  <i>q</i><sub>1</sub>, ...,
<i>q</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>. In teaching it is convenient
to start with a set of equally spaced proportion values,
say 0, .1, .2, ..., 1, and then give the student guidance
on the choice of prior probabilities.  One relatively easy
method of assigning probabilities is based on relative
likelihoods.  For example, the student can assign a large
value, say 10, to the proportion value that is most
likely, assign 5 to values of <i>p</i> that are half as
likely as the most likely value, and so  on.  At the end of
the process, the student can divide the assigned numbers by
their sum to obtain a proper probability distribution.
Using this algorithm, the student can obtain a prior that
is a rough approximation to her initial opinion about the
location of the population proportion.</p>

<p>12 After this prior has been constructed, data are
observed, and the student updates her probabilities by
means of Bayes' rule.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#Table1">Table 1</a>
illustrates the calculation of the posterior
probabilities.  The "Proportion values" line lists the
<i>k</i> possible proportion values, and the "Prior" line
the corresponding prior probabilities.  If <i>s</i> smokers
and <i>f</i> nonsmokers are sampled, then the likelihood of
a particular proportion value <i>p</i> is 
<i>p</i><sup><i>s</i></sup>(1 -
<i>p</i>)<sup><i>f</i></sup>. The likelihoods of the
different proportion values are shown in the "Likelihood"
row.  The posterior probabilities of the proportions are
proportional to the respective products of the prior
probabilities and likelihoods -- these products are shown
in the "Product" row.  The posterior probabilities, shown
in the "Posterior" row, are obtained by dividing each
product by the sum of the products (denoted by <i>SP</i>
in  Table 1).</p>

<p>13 The computation of the posterior probabilities can be
tedious for the student, and software is needed to
facilitate this task.  I have written a  Javascript
Web-based program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/p_discrete.html">http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/p_discrete.html</a>
to simplify this calculation.  The student enters his or
her prior by typing numbers in the "PRIOR"  column of a
spreadsheet, values of <i>s</i> and <i>f</i> are placed in
"DATA" boxes  on the web page, and all of the calculations
are displayed in the  spreadsheet when an "UPDATE" button
is pressed.</p>

<p>14 The posterior probabilities can be interpreted as the
actual probabilities that the proportion <i>p</i> takes on
the <i>k</i> individual values.  An interval estimate for
<i>p</i> can be constructed by first ordering the values of
<i>p</i> by their posterior probabilities, most likely
values first, and then putting values of <i>p</i> into a
confidence set until the total probability of the set
exceeds .95.  Suppose that the confidence set turns out to
be <i>S</i> = {.1, .2, .3, .4}. The probability that the
proportion of interest <i>p</i> is contained in the set
<i>S</i> is at least .95.</p>


<h1>3. The Sample Survey Project </h1>


<h2>3.1 The Assignment </h2>

<p>15 In the sample survey project, students were asked to
think of two questions of interest to the undergraduate
student body, each question having two possible answers,
yes or no. The goal of the survey was to learn about
population proportions, where the population of interest is
the undergraduate student body, and the proportions are the
fractions of the students who would answer yes to each of
the two questions.  To learn about the proportions, the
students took a single random sample of at least 40
students and asked each sampled student the two questions.
Based on the observed data, the students were asked to
construct interval estimates for each of the two
proportions of interest and to interpret what they learned
from this survey.</p>

<p>16 The students worked on these projects in groups of
size three or smaller. A major component of this project
was the writing of a final report that gave all details of
the statistical investigation.  Specific guidelines were
given on the contents of this report.  The project report
was to contain the following components:

</p><ol> 
<li><b>Introduction.</b>  The students were to
describe how they decided on their particular inference
problems.  What motivated them to choose the particular two
questions?  Were they based on some personal experience,
something they had read in the newspaper, or something
else?

<p></p></li><li><b>Prior opinion.</b>  Before they took their sample, what did the students think they would find out?  Could the students make an intelligent guess at each population proportion value?  If there were differences in opinion between members of the group, they were asked to discuss those differences and the rationale for each opinion.

<p></p></li><li><b>Sampling.</b>  The students were supposed to explain in detail how they took their random sample.  What particular sampling method was used and how many students were called?
Were there any difficulties encountered in collecting the data?

<p></p></li><li><b>The data.</b>  The results of the survey should be explained in detail.  Specifically, students were asked to list the data in a raw form that displayed the responses to each question for each student in the sample.

<p></p></li><li><b>The inference.</b>  The students were asked to write down all of the work involved in constructing the 95% probability intervals.  This included a reference (page number in the book) for the methodology that was used and all of the details of the computation.

<p></p></li><li><b>Interpretation.</b>
The students were asked to explain what 95% confidence means in the context of their individual survey problems.  This interpretation should be made using language understandable by a layman who is not familiar with 
statistics jargon.

<p></p></li><li><b>Wrap-up.</b>
At the end of the report, the students were asked to discuss what they learned from their project.  Were the results surprising?  Were any problems encountered in doing the project?  If the students had to do the project again, what would be done differently?

</li></ol>


<h2>3.2 Project Results </h2>

<p>17 A total of 12 projects were completed by the student
groups.  I first summarize the contents of the project
reports.  I next discuss the students' specifications  of
their priors and their interpretations of their interval
estimates.  The results of the projects motivated changes to
the project implementation that were followed in the second
year.</p>


<h3>3.2.1 Questions Posed </h3>

<p>18 Generally, the students asked survey questions  on
topics that interested them.  Some representative
survey questions were:</p>


<ul>
<li>Do you regularly attend university sporting events?
</li><li>Do you own a car?
</li><li>Do you drink regularly on weekends?
</li><li>Do you enjoy living on campus?
</li><li>Do you have a TV in your room?
</li></ul>

<p>Note that these questions are distinctively different
from many sample survey questions that are posed in
elementary statistics textbooks.  Most of the questions
deal with issues in the students' daily lives, including
their social behavior, their living conditions, what they
do on weekends, and so on. There were very few questions on
political issues, such as their feelings about abortion or
their agreement with the policies  of the President of the
United States.  The important thing to note is that the
students asked questions on subjects that
genuinely interested them -- they wanted to learn about the
feelings of fellow students on these subjects.</p>


<h3>3.2.2 Prior Opinions </h3>

<p>19 One distinctive feature of the Bayesian viewpoint is
that the prior probability distribution provides a
mechanism for the student to input his or her opinion about
the proportion value. Initially the students expressed an
opinion by means of a guess at the proportion value.  A
statement such as</p>

<blockquote>
"We assumed that around 30% of students had cars on campus"
</blockquote>

<p>was typical.   An alternative and equally valid method of
expressing this prior opinion guessed at the number of
students in the sample who would say yes to the particular
question:</p>

<blockquote> 
"We estimated that about 36 out of our 40
sampled people would say yes for the weekend."
</blockquote>

<p> This statement indicates a preference for making a
prediction of the future sample result <i>s</i> instead of
guessing at the population parameter value <i>p</i>. 
Suppose a student wishes to learn about the proportion of
students on campus who own cars.   It can be difficult for
the student to directly guess at  the proportion of all
students who own cars since  this population parameter is
an abstract characteristic of a model whose value will
never be known with certainty.  In contrast, it can be
easier to predict the number of students owning cars in a
future sample of size 40.  This sample result is a more
tangible quantity whose value will be known once the survey
is completed.</p>

<p>20 After a guess at the proportion value was made,  the
students followed the general advice on constructing a
prior provided in class.  They set up a grid of values for
<i>p</i> and assigned the largest prior probability to
their best guess of this proportion. Most  of the prior
distributions constructed were relatively diffused about
the most likely value. These distributions possibly
reflected the students' lack of knowledge about the results
of their survey.  More likely, since the construction of a
prior distribution is not easy to perform in practice, the
students may have imitated examples of prior distributions
that were discussed in class.</p>


<h3>3.2.3 Can the Students Accurately Specify Priors? </h3>

<p>21 One criticism of the Bayesian viewpoint is the
subjective nature of the inference. The posterior
distribution depends on both the data and the prior which
reflects one's belief about the location of the
proportion.  If a student does a poor job in specifying the
prior, that is, the prior does not accurately reflect his
or her subjective beliefs, then the inference based on the
posterior distribution may be suspect.</p>

<p>22 That raises the interesting question:  are students
able to accurately specify priors for unknown quantities
about which they have a good amount of information?  A
simple experiment was performed to address this question. 
The first item on their final test asked each student to
give a probability distribution (see Table 2) for his or
her letter grade on the test. </p> 

<a name="Table2"><hr></a>

<p><b>Table 2.</b> Probability Distribution Table for
Students to Fill Out Regarding Their Grade on Their Final
Test </p>

</tbody></table>

<p></p><hr><p></p>

<p>23 The students had not yet been tested on the material
on the final test.  However, each student probably had a
good idea how he or she was performing in the class and
likely could make an educated guess at his or her grade on
this test.  Is a student able to specify a probability
distribution on the grades A, B, C, D, F that reflects
this knowledge?</p>

<p>24 It was found that the students appeared to give
reasonable prior distributions on the letter grades.  Most
of the students assigned their most likely grade a
probability value between .4 and .6, and then spread out
the remaining probability on neighboring grades.  All of
the students specified proper probability distributions
where the values were nonnegative and summed to one.   Two
students assigned the "unreasonable" uniform probability
distribution where each grade was assigned a probability of
.2.</p>

<p>25 One way of assessing the accuracy of the students'
probability distributions is to relate them to the actual
scores on this final test.  For each student's prior, a
mean prior grade was computed by assigning the usual 
four-point scale to the letter grades (A = 4, F = 0), and
then computing the mean of the probability distribution of
the scores. </p>

<p>26 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#Figure1">Figure 1</a> displays a
scatterplot of the students' actual test grades and their
mean prior grades.  One sees a strong positive trend -- if
one removes the two outlying points which correspond to the
uniform priors, the correlation between the actual and
prior mean grades is .875. The fitted regression line to
the points (with the two outliers removed) is

</p><p></p><center>ACTUAL_GRADE = 11.3 + 22.5 × PRIOR_GRADE</center><p></p>

<p>The students, on average, were on target in predicting
their test grades.    Using the above regression line, a
student with a prior grade of 3.5 would receive a test
grade of 90, a student with a prior grade of 2.5 would
receive a test grade of 68, and so on.</p>

<hr>

<p>27 The results of this experiment are encouraging.  The
students appear able to specify reasonably accurate
probability distributions for an unknown quantity (their
grade) about which they know something. </p>  


<h3>3.2.4 The Impact of the Prior on the Posterior
Inference </h3>

<p>28 The previous section questioned the accuracy of the
priors specified by the students.  This raises a second
issue.  Given that students will possess different prior
beliefs about the proportion of interest and therefore
specify different prior distributions, how sensitive is the
posterior inference to the choice of
prior?</p>

<p>29 I address this concern by focusing on one survey
project.  One group was interested in learning about the
proportion of campus students who believed they got enough
sleep at night.  Three students, Arica, Sara, and Caroline,
each specified a prior for this proportion over the values 
<i>p</i> = 0, .1, .2, ..., 1.  Looking at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/albert.cfm#Table3">Table 3</a>, one sees different prior
beliefs reflected in these distributions.  Arica's prior is
quite spread out with a mode of .4, Sara's prior is less
diffuse with a mode of .3, and Caroline places a large
probability on the value <i>p</i> = .2.  The group took a
sample of 40 students, and 19 students said that they got
enough sleep.  The posterior probabilities for each of the
three students are also shown in the table. Although the
students had substantially different prior beliefs, note
that their posterior distributions are very similar.  For
each student, most of the probability (82-88%) is
concentrated on the values  <i>p</i> = .4, .5.  This
example illustrates that the posterior distribution is
relatively insensitive to the choice of prior.  Moreover,
it illustrates the convergence of beliefs of people when
they have obtained more information.</p>

<h3>3.2.5 Sampling </h3>

<p>30 Students may have learned the most in the sampling
phase of the project.  Although they had been exposed to the
notion of a random sample earlier in the course, they had
not really thought about drawing such a sample in a real
situation. Some students thought that various types of
convenience samples were reasonable to use, and this
thinking motivated a class discussion of the types of
biases that could be introduced by the use of these
nonrandom samples.</p>



<h3>3.2.6 Inference and Interpretation </h3>

<p>31 For most of the student groups, the actual
implementation of the statistical methodology was
relatively easy.  Only a few groups calculated the interval
incorrectly.  Currently my students use a Javascript
program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/p_discrete.html">http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/p_discrete.html</a>
to compute the posterior probabilities.</p>

<p>32 An important component of the project report was the
interpretation of the survey results.  Although the
Bayesian interval estimate was easy to compute,  it was
more difficult to provide the correct interpretation of the
procedure, especially using non-statistical language that
could be understood by the person on the street.</p>

<p>33 What is the correct interpretation of 95% confidence
from a Bayesian viewpoint?  If the computed interval
estimate for <i>p</i> is (.23, .42), then it is correct to
say, "The probability that the proportion <i>p</i> is
contained in  (.23, .42) is .95."  The interpretations from
ten of the projects are listed below.

</p><ol>
<li>The estimates that we were given tell us that 95% of the undergraduates surveyed fall between the probabilities of 50% and 60% when answering the first question.  It was more likely for 50-60% percent of the people interviewed to enjoy going out on the weekends.  In other words, if you asked forty people if they liked to go out on the weekends or weekdays, 20-24 of them would answer the weekends.

<p></p></li><li>The 95% interval was (.2, .7) which means that between 20% and 70% of the students fall in the category of living more than 100 miles from campus and go home more than twice a semester.

<p></p></li><li>95% of the data plus or minus .05 will lie between .033-.029.

<p></p></li><li>95% means that the probability that the proportion of  students who smoke at least once a day is in the set of <i>p</i> = .2, .3, .4 is 95% -- a very very good chance.  In other words, there is a 95% chance that <i>p</i> =  .2, .3 or .4.  That means that it is very unlikely that the <i>p</i> value would be anything other than .2, .3, .4.

<p></p></li><li>The 95% interval means that 95% of the sample lies between .4 and .6 for the question of students going home on the weekends and for the question of not enough weekend activities, the sample results lie between .6 and .8.

<p></p></li><li>What the 95% means is that of our prior data, we were correct to 95% between .1 and .3.  Basically, that between these two percentiles is where you will find the most girls on campus with boyfriends.

<p></p></li><li>The 95% interval estimate for question 1 says that the answer is between .4 and .6.  That means that there is a 95% chance that between 40 to 60 percent of people prefer basketball to football.

<p></p></li><li>The 95% interval estimate means that between the priors of .1-.5 is the set of proportion values for the probability set.  That means that the proportion is in this set of 95%.

<p></p></li><li>The 95% interval means that .95 of the response fell between .3 and .5, which is also where the majority is located on the graph.  So the majority of undergraduates do not skip class regularly and do not stay out late during the week.

<p></p></li><li>95% of the probabilities fall between .7 and .9.  This means that 70 to 90% of the students sampled think that the food on campus is overpriced.
</li></ol>

<p>34 Projects numbered 4, 7, and 10 gave essentially
correct interpretations -- they all talked about the
probability of the proportion <i>p</i> falling in the
confidence set. A common mistake (responses 3, 5, 9) was to
confuse probabilities of the proportion <i>p</i> with
probabilities of different data results. For example,
project 5 stated that "95% of the sample lies between .4
and .6" and project 9 said that ".95 of the response fell
between .3 and .5." These responses are incorrect because
one knows with certainly the proportion of yes's and no's
in the sample. Project 1 incorrectly stated that 95% of the
population falls within the interval limits. The remaining
three responses were incomplete but harder to classify.
Responses 2,  6, and 8 made statements about the interval
estimate that don't refer to probabilities.  For example,
it is difficult to understand what project 6 meant by
"correct to 95% between .1 and .3."</p>



<h2>3.3 Evaluation -- How Were the Projects Deficient? </h2>

<p>35 Although the survey project was generally successful,
there were particular components of the project that needed
improvement.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Priors.</b>
The construction of the prior distribution is likely a difficult task for most of the students.
It was not clear that each student formed his or her own prior -- the prior that a group used for their project may have been constructed by a single student.  Moreover, from reading the project reports, it appeared that the construction of the prior and the data may have been confounded.
The prior should reflect one's prior beliefs <i>before</i> any data has been collected.  If the students worked on their project the last week before the assignment date, they might have simply based their prior beliefs on some of the sample survey results.

<p></p></li><li><b>Sampling.</b>
Although the students were taught basic principles of random sampling, they were not taught specific methods for selecting a random sample from the student body.  The standard method of taking a simple random sample by means of a random digit table was not applicable for their problems, and alternative sampling schemes were required.
It was unclear from reading the project reports if valid samples were indeed taken.

<p></p></li><li><b>Interpretation.</b>
As demonstrated above, the students had difficulties in correctly interpreting their interval estimates.  It was clear that there should be more instruction on the meaning of a Bayesian probability interval.

<p></p></li><li><b>Writing of report.</b> 
The project reports were generally too brief.  The students
often did not explain why they were interested in their
particular survey questions or how the prior distribution
reflected their prior beliefs. Some of the students seemed
to think that the numerical work (the displaying of the
prior and posterior probabilities and the computation of
the interval estimate) "spoke for itself." Some of the
reports were deficient in explaining how the students'
prior beliefs were changed by the data and what they
learned from the survey project.

</li></ol>



<h2>3.4 Revision of the Project Assignment </h2>

<p>36 In response to the concerns stated above, changes
were made to the project assignment in the following year's
class. (The revised project assignment, including a prior
distribution worksheet, can be found at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/project_assignment.html">http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/project_assignment.html</a>.)
The project was divided into three stages, and each group
had to turn in a written report when each stage was
completed.</p>

<p>37 The first stage of the report included the choice of
survey questions and the construction of the prior
probability distributions.  Every student was asked to
complete a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064027/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/make_prior.html">"Prior Distribution Worksheet"</a> for each survey
question.  This worksheet included blanks for the question
to be asked,  the meaning of the proportion <i>p</i> in
this setting, the student's guess at the value of <i>p</i>, 
and a table of prior probabilities.   This report also
included a description of the proposed methodology for
selecting a random sample from the student body.</p>

<p>38 The second stage of the report described the "data
phase" of the investigation.  In this report, the
individual survey responses would be listed, and the group
would summarize these data.  This summary would include the
proportions of students who answered "yes" and "no" to
each question and bar charts that displayed these
proportions.</p>

<p>39 The final stage of the report focused on the
statistical inference.  The projects would contain a
description of the calculation of the interval estimates,
an interpretation of these intervals, and a summary of what
the students learned in this project. </p> 

<p>40 The main rationale behind these stages was to give the
instructor more opportunity to evaluate the students'
progress on the project.  Since there were multiple
opportunities for feedback, the instructor would be able to
suggest changes that would help in completing a successful
project. The instructor could suggest the rewording of a
confusing survey question, question the construction of a
prior distribution, or criticize the sampling methodology. 
These interactions helped to reinforce ideas in probability
and statistics that were discussed in class.</p>



<h2>3.5 The Projects in the Second Year </h2>

<p>41 The students in the second year's class generally did
well on their survey projects. Due to the inclusion of the
prior worksheets, there was more evidence that the students
worked on constructing their prior distributions.   There
was more care in selecting their random samples.   In
addition, due to the class discussion time, the students
were more successful in correctly interpreting their
interval estimates.</p>

<p>42 The following interpretation was provided by a group
that was interested in the proportion of campus students
who wore a watch:</p>


<blockquote>
The 70% probability set for question one fell between .7 and .8.  This means that there is a 70% chance that between 70-80% of the undergraduate students wear a watch.
</blockquote>

<p> Of the eleven group project reports,  nine included
an interpretation similar to the one above.  In each of
these nine reports, there was a  statement on the chance or
probability that the computed interval contained a
proportion.   However, only four of these nine reports
explicitly referred to the proportion of the population of
undergraduate students.  Three reports talked vaguely about
the "proportion of people," one report incorrectly
referred to the proportion of survey participants, and one
report didn't explicitly say what proportion they were
talking about.  So, although most all of the reports used
the right phrases in interpreting the probability interval,
it is not clear that all of the students understood that
they were constructing an interval for a population
proportion.</p>

<p>43  A few groups went beyond the basic interpretation of
the probability interval.  These groups were able to
discuss what they learned about the proportion of interest
by comparing the prior and posterior distributions. One
group reported:</p>

<blockquote> This interval set (.5 to .6) is lower than our
prior probability range.  Originally, we had the set of 
<nobr><i>p</i> = .4, .5, .6, and .7</nobr> to be the
90% interval set.  However, the actual probability set has
a shorter range with lesser possibilities. </blockquote>

<p> This group observed the basic fact that, as one
collects more data, the length of the probability interval
for the proportion will decrease.  The Bayesian approach
allows one to see the impact of the data by comparing the
prior and posterior probability distributions.  For future
classes it would be beneficial to spend more class time on
the comparison of probability distributions so that students
can relate the prior to the posterior in their project
write-ups.  It would be instructive, for example, to have
the students compare two posterior distributions -- one
for the full dataset and one for half of the dataset.</p>

<p>44 Generally, the quality of the projects improved in the
second year's class.  However, based on the above analysis,
there is a concern that the students were relying too much
on the instructor's guidance in completing the reports. 
There was additional time devoted in class to the proper
interpretation of the confidence intervals, and some groups
may have mimicked the instructor's wording of "confidence"
without really understanding the interpretation of  a
posterior probability distribution.  </p>


<h1>4. Concluding Remarks </h1>

<p>45 The sample survey project used in this Bayesian class
has several desirable features. First, the students 
actually perform a complete statistical analysis on
problems of genuine interest to them.  It is easy to spend
more time on the relatively glamorous topics of data
analysis and inference without discussing the motivation
for the particular statistical study or how the data were
collected. Often statistical studies are useless because
the wrong questions were asked or the data were collected
by means of a nonrandom sample or poor experimental
design.  The students begin to recognize these problems
when they do their own study. Second, the prior is a useful
construct to get the students thinking about the parameter
of interest.  Believe it or not, students in an elementary
statistics class often do not understand the difference
between a parameter and a statistic, and the Bayesian prior
helps in overcoming this confusion. Last, the Bayesian
interpretations of statistical conclusions are somewhat
intuitive.  The Bayesian student can talk about the
probability that his interval contains the unknown
proportion -- this is a valid Bayesian statement because
the parameter is a random variable.</p>

<p>46 However, this article has demonstrated some potential
problems in the implementation of this project.  The
students can be careless in specifying their priors, and
they can make mistakes in taking their sample survey or
interpreting their inferential results.  In the second
year's class, changes were made to the assignment that
enabled the instructor to provide constructive feedback on
the different aspects of the project.  This feedback helped
to reinforce many of the key ideas in the course and also
helped the students to write more complete reports.  It
seems that a continuous dialog between the instructor and
students is necessary to ensure the success of the
project.</p>
