<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The dataset "Career Records For All Modern Position
Players Eligible For The Major League Baseball Hall of
Fame" contains information for the 1340 major league
baseball players who had retired prior to the 1993 season
and who were eligible for the Major League Baseball Hall of
Fame (had played in at least ten seasons).  Traditional
performance measures included are number of seasons played,
games played, official at-bats (AB), runs scored, hits (H),
doubles (2B), triples (3B), home runs (HR), runs batted in
(RBI), walks (BB), strikeouts (SO), batting average (BA),
on base percentage (OBP), slugging percentage (SLG), stolen
bases (SB), times caught stealing (CS), fielding average
(FA), and primary position played (POS).  In addition, the
following composite measures are included:  adjusted
production (AP), batting runs (BR), adjusted batting runs
(ABR), runs created (RC), stolen base runs (SBR), fielding
runs (FR), and total player rating (TPR).  Finally, the
dataset includes an indication of whether or not each
player has been admitted into the Major League Baseball
Hall of Fame and, if so, under what set of rules he was
admitted.</p>


<h1>1. Introduction</h1>


<p>1 In Major League Baseball, a wide variety of
performance measures are collected for individual players.
These measurements, which stimulate interest in both casual
and serious baseball fans, are widely disseminated and at
least reasonably well understood by a large proportion of
the U.S. population. Indeed, baseball phrases such as
<i>hitting a home run</i>, <i>striking out</i>, and <i>play
ball!</i> are part of our nation's collective lexicon.
Because of this broad interest, measurements of Major
League Baseball player performances are particularly useful
in classroom demonstrations of various statistical
concepts.</p>

<p>2 One of the most controversial topics of debate among
baseball fans is the question of which players have earned,
by virtue of their career performances, membership in the
Major League Baseball Hall of Fame. There are two ways in
which membership may be conferred upon a player. Five years
after his retirement, the player becomes eligible for
election by the Baseball Writers' Association of America
(the BBWAA). At this stage a player is inducted if he can,
in an annual election, gain the support of at least 75% of
all writers who have belonged to the BBWAA for at least ten
years. If a player is not elected by the BBWAA within
twenty years of his retirement, the Veterans Committee may
then consider him for induction. This is a small committee
comprised of retired players, managers, coaches, and
administrators with many years of experience in Major
League Baseball. The Veterans Committee also meets annually
and may choose to induct any player no longer eligible for
election by the BBWAA. This committee's purpose is somewhat
similar to that of the Old Timers Committee, which was
disbanded a few years after the establishment of the Major
League Baseball Hall of Fame because it was felt at that
time that the committee had outlived its usefulness.
Finally, a player must have played at least ten major
league seasons to be eligible for membership in the Major
League Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>3 Because the variable of primary interest (<i>Major
League Baseball Hall of Fame Membership</i>) in this
dataset is categorical, the dataset is appropriate for use
in a course on generalized linear models, classification,
or discrimination. The career performance measures for the
players are suitable independent variables, and each player
included in the dataset constitutes one record/observation.
Additionally, the data can be (and have been) used to
demonstrate concepts in descriptive statistics, basic
inference, and multivariate statistics.</p>

<h1>2. The Dataset</h1>

<p>4 These data appear in <cite>Total Baseball</cite> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#Thorn93">Thorn and Palmer 1993</a>) and <cite>The
Baseball Encyclopedia</cite> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#Reichler">Reichler
1993</a>). The data include the traditional performance
measures <i>Number of Seasons Played, Games Played,
Official At-Bats, Runs Scored, Hits, Doubles, Triples, Home
Runs, Runs Batted In, Walks, Strikeouts, Batting Average,
On Base Percentage, Slugging Percentage, Stolen Bases,
Caught Stealing,</i> and <i>Fielding Average</i> for each
modern (post-1900) position player with at least ten years
of major league experience. The <i>Primary Position Played
by the Player</i> throughout his career, defined as the
position at which the player played the most games in his
career, is also included. This variable is coded in the
following manner:</p>

<dl>
<dt></dt><dd>C = Catcher,
</dd><dt></dt><dd>1 = First Base,
</dd><dt></dt><dd>2 = Second Base,
</dd><dt></dt><dd>3 = Third Base,
</dd><dt></dt><dd>S = Shortstop,
</dd><dt></dt><dd>O = Outfield, and
</dd><dt></dt><dd>D = Designated Hitter.
</dd></dl>


<p>5 Additionally, an indication of the <i>Player's Hall of
Fame Membership Status</i> is included. This variable is
coded in the following manner:</p>

<dl>
<dt></dt><dd>0 = Not a member,
</dd><dt></dt><dd>1 = Elected by the BBWAA, and
</dd><dt></dt><dd>2 = Chosen by the Old Timers Committee or Veterans Committee.
</dd></dl>


<p>6 The Old Timers Committee, which existed for only a
brief period early in the life of the Hall of Fame, was
charged with selecting players whose careers were in the
nineteenth century. After the demise of the Old Timers
Committee, the Veterans Committee was formed and given the
responsibility of selecting players overlooked by the
BBWAA. Understandably, their selections have often been the
source of great controversy (by definition, a player under
consideration by the Veterans Committee has already been
deemed undeserving by baseball writers).</p>

<p>7 Finally, various composite measures developed by
sabermatricians including John Thorn and Pete Palmer 
(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#Thorn84">1984</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#Thorn93">1993</a>) 
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#James">Bill James (1982)</a> are included. Definitions and

<p>8 The traditional performance measures are readily
available and widely disseminated, and so they are most
likely the primary objective criteria used by BBWAA and
Veterans Committee members in deciding for whom they will
vote. However, the composite measures have been developed
in response to perceived inadequacies in the traditional
measures. Although the composite measures have gained
exposure in recent years, they still are not widely
accepted and so are not likely to be considered explicitly
by BBWAA and Veterans Committee members. In fact, some
eschew the use of these measures because they believe the
measures are contrived and ill conceived. However, their
inclusion in this dataset is interesting because it allows
for some assessment of their validity and consistency with
traditional measures.</p>


<h1>3. Classroom Use</h1>

<p>9 I regularly teach a one-quarter (ten weeks) standard
introductory business statistics course. In this course I
cover basic descriptive statistical methods (numerical,
graphical, and tabular), probability, sampling
distributions, and confidence intervals. I have used these
data extensively in this course to demonstrate descriptive
statistics. For example, the data can be used to illustrate
why bar charts based on relative or percentage frequencies
are more meaningful than bar charts based on absolute
frequencies when comparing two groups of different sizes.
Back-to-back bar charts of <i>Primary Position Played</i>
for Hall of Fame members and non-members, based on absolute
frequencies, are given in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#figure1">Figure
1</a>.</p>


<a name="figure1"><hr></a>

<p>

</p>

<p></p><hr><p></p>

<p>10 It is difficult, based on this graph, to discern if
there is a positional bias in Hall of Fame membership. The
large discrepancy in the sizes of the two groups (the
dataset consists of 124 position players who are members of
the Hall of Fame and 1216 who are not members) masks
relative differences. However, a similar chart based on
relative frequencies, such as the chart provided in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#figure2">Figure 2</a>, makes the bias much more
evident. </p>

<p>11 Using total number of players eligible as our basis,
it is easy to see that outfielders and first basemen enjoy
overrepresentation in the Hall of Fame, and third basemen
and catchers suffer from under-representation. At this
point I also discuss the importance of the basis of
comparison—if we used at-bats or games played as our
basis, catchers may not appear to be underrepresented. This
is, of course, because the demands of the position
generally limit catchers to shorter careers.</p>

<p>12 I also provide my students with a similar example
using <i>Total Player Rating</i> by <i>Hall of Fame
Status</i> (eligible but not elected, elected by the BBWAA,
elected by the Veterans Committee). A sample side-by-side
histogram is provided in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#figure3">Figure
3</a>.</p>

<a name="figure3"><hr></a>
<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/cochran03.new.gif">
<img src="./cochran_8_2_files/cochran03.icon.jpg">Figure 3 (4.3K gif)</a>
<p>
Figure 3.  Absolute Frequencies for Hall of Fame Membership by Total 
Player Rating.
</p>

<p></p><hr><p></p>


<p>13 This side-by-side histogram does suggest that the
great majority of eligible players with relatively low
<i>Total Player Ratings</i> are not in the Hall of Fame.
However, the broad scale of the <i>y</i>-axis, necessitated
by the large discrepancy in the size of the three groups
(1216 eligible players who are not members of the Hall of
Fame, 57 position players who have been elected by the
BBWAA to the Hall of Fame, and 67 position players who have
been elected by the Veterans Committee to the Hall of Fame)
makes it difficult to draw further conclusions. Again, a
similar chart based on percentage frequencies, such as the
chart provided in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#figure4">Figure 4</a>, is more
revealing.</p>


<a name="figure4"><hr></a>
<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/cochran04.new.gif">
<img src="./cochran_8_2_files/cochran04.icon.jpg">Figure 4 (6.4K gif)</a>
<p>
Figure 4.  Percentage Frequencies for Hall of Fame Membership by Total 
Player Rating.
</p>

<p></p><hr><p></p>



<p>14 From this chart we can conclude that the BBWAA
generally elects players with the highest <i>Total Player
Ratings</i>. Furthermore, the Veterans Committee, choosing
from players who have been passed over by the BBWAA,
generally elects players from the remaining pool with the
highest <i>Total Player Ratings</i>. Thus we observe some
agreement between the composite measurement <i>Total Player
Rating</i> and the behavior of the BBWAA and Veterans
Committee. We also see potential explanations for the
controversy regarding some of the selections made by the
Veterans Committee.</p>

<p>15 Frequently I also teach a one-quarter follow-up
introductory course on inferential methods for business. In
this course I introduce one-sample and two-sample
hypothesis testing techniques, chi-square tests of
independence and equality of proportions, one-factor and
two-factor analysis of variance, and simple and multiple
linear regression analysis. I have used these data
extensively in this course as well. For example, I ask
students to consider independence of total career<i>
Strikeouts</i> and <i>Hall of Fame Membership Status</i>.
The resulting summary of the data could look like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#Table1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>17 The <i>p</i>-value associated with the corresponding
 <img align="MIDDLE" src="./cochran_8_2_files/chisq.gif"> value (67.529) for
 six degrees of freedom is less than 0.0001, supporting
 rejection of the hypothesis of independence between total
 career <i>Strikeouts </i>and <i>Hall of Fame Membership
 Status</i>. A further review of the individual cell <img align="MIDDLE" src="./cochran_8_2_files/chisq.gif"> values reveals that the
 actual number of Hall of Fame members in the high
 strikeout categories <nobr>(1000 - 1250,</nobr> <nobr>1250
 - 1500,</nobr> <nobr><img align="MIDDLE" src="./cochran_8_2_files/geq.gif">
 1500)</nobr> greatly exceeds what would be expected if
 total career <i>Strikeouts</i> and <i>Hall of Fame
 Membership Status </i>were independent. A classroom
 discussion on possible explanations (length of career,
 relative propensity for home run hitters to strike out,
 etc.) for this seemingly paradoxical relationship
 ensues.</p>

<p>18 These data are also useful in multivariate statistics
courses. Factor analysis of the traditional performance
measurements for all players included in this dataset can
be used to derive latent patterns that may represent
'prototypes' of baseball players with long careers. 
Canonical correlation analysis of the traditional
performance measurements against the composite performance
measurements may yield interesting insight into the
reliability of the composite measures. Finally, the dataset
is well suited for demonstration of generalized linear
models, as well as various methods for classification and
discrimination. In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.new.cfm#Cochran">Cochran and Levy (2000)</a> have
applied regression tree methodology to these data in an
attempt to explain Hall of Fame membership.</p>

<p>19 Because of the general level of interest in baseball,
these data are extremely valuable in providing examples
that lend insight and promote enthusiasm among students.
Those students who are fans of baseball are more engaged
and motivated by such examples. While the remaining
students might not share their classmates' enthusiasm, they
cannot help but be impressed by the usefulness of
statistics when applied to something as 'mundane' as
baseball.</p>

<h2>Corrections</h2>

<p>This article was republished with corrections in November
2000.  The dataset was modified to include players
recently inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of
Fame.  In addition, some players who had not finished their
baseball careers were inadvertently included in the
original dataset and have now been removed.  These
additions and deletions changed counts of players in the
abstract and in paragraphs 10 and 13 of the article.  The
figures and tables and the <img align="MIDDLE" src="./cochran_8_2_files/chisq.gif"> value in paragraph 17 have been
modified to reflect the changes.  The original version of
the article is available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064018/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.cfm">http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/datasets.cochran.cfm</a>.
