<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The First International Conference on the Teaching of
Mathematics was held in Samos, Greece, in July 1998. 
Presentations by the attendees reflected a recent debate on
reforms of the mathematics curriculum and related
pedagogy.  Chief among these was a greater emphasis on
connecting the mathematics curriculum with applications, to
make courses in mathematics more &quot;relevant&quot; to
students.  This manuscript notes that mathematicians tend
to teach students to approach data analysis in a
constructive manner, proceeding from an understanding of
the basic science, while statisticians concentrate on
reductive approaches, whereby models are generated upon
consideration of the data themselves.  It is suggested that
departments of mathematics and statistics will need to
adopt a new spirit of cooperation, and partner with
colleagues in application areas, if curricular enhancements
in either domain are to have a reasonable chance at
success.</p>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>


<p>1 In Lynne <a href="#billard">Billard's (1998)</a> recent
discussion of &quot;The Role of Statistics and the
Statistician,&quot; she laments that many of our academic,
business, and governmental leaders and colleagues are still
&quot;unversed in the statistical method.&quot;  Most of
these persons are former students who were missed during
the primary window-of-opportunity for such training: their
formative undergraduate years.  Some took &quot;hated&quot;
courses in statistics.  Others avoided statistical training
altogether.  Dr. Billard reiterates an opinion shared by
many of us, that reforms to address this multifaceted
problem continue to be needed throughout the statistics
curriculum.  In particular, she states</p>

<blockquote><p>... it is also my belief wholeheartedly that
to train our students for the 21st Century, it will be
necessary for the often exclusively theoretically based
program to move toward what we might call an &quot;applied
theoretical&quot; and/or an &quot;applied-applied&quot;
emphasis to remain viable, rather than the reverse (p.
321).</p></blockquote>

<p>2 While it is true that we statisticians could do a
better job of popularizing the statistical method to our
students and to society, most of today's statistics
curriculum is taught outside the context of departments of
statistics.  Many students take statistics courses offered
by departments of psychology, nursing and medicine,
economics and business, engineering, chemistry, and so on. 
These are often taught by faculty with Ph.D.'s in their
respective fields and with substantial practical experience
in statistical application, but without degrees in
statistics itself.  Other students are introduced to
statistics under the umbrella of a mathematics curriculum. 
<a href="#loftsgaarden">Loftsgaarden and Watkins (1998)</a> 
report in the same issue of
<i>The American Statistician</i> that 76.1% of students
taking a statistics course in the fall of 1995 through
undergraduate programs in the mathematical sciences were
enrolled in courses offered by departments of mathematics. 
While many of these faculty do have Ph.D.'s in statistics,
the fact that their courses are part of a mathematics
curriculum suggests that curricular reforms in other areas
of mathematics will play an important role in determining
the success or failure of reforms introduced at the
undergraduate level by statisticians.</p>

<p>3 This summer I was one of two or three statisticians
(if one counts the chemist) who had the opportunity to
attend the First International Conference on the Teaching
of Mathematics, on the island of Samos, Greece.  There I
learned that the field of mathematics is undergoing a great
degree of upheaval, with many potential repercussions for
the field of statistics.  Mathematicians are seeking to
reverse the declines in enrollment in mathematics courses,
estimated at about a 9% decline between 1990 and 1995 for
courses given at four-year colleges and universities (<a href="#loftsgaarden">Loftsgaarden and Watkins 1998</a>). 
During the same time period, statistics enrollments in
mathematical sciences programs have increased 26%. 
Consequently, the traditionally theoretical field of
mathematics is currently undergoing a crisis of identity,
with many mathematicians calling for curricular reforms
that would stress to their students the relevance of
mathematical training.  The reforms discussed in Samos were
directed at students at many levels, from elementary school
to graduate education.  Of the reforms directed at
undergraduate education, many were directed towards
students seeking degrees in partially or wholly
quantitative natural and social sciences.</p>

<p>4 Many of the participants at the Samos conference
emphasized the use of mathematical modeling, particularly
computer- or calculator-oriented modeling, either as a
pedagogical tool for illustrating mathematical concepts and
enhancing understanding, or as the end goal of mathematics
instruction.  Proponents of this approach argue that
participatory modeling of real world phenomena, especially
in the context of a wider curriculum, is a viable way to
transmit a mathematical toolbox while creatively involving
students in the subject material (<a href="#mumford">Mumford 1997</a>).  
Opponents
fear a corresponding loss of mathematical rigor, often
characterized as &quot;the death of the proof.&quot;  They
argue that the study of &quot;pure&quot; mathematics has
instilled in generations of lay persons a healthy respect
for logic, as well as assisted many an insightful
scientist.  Thus, they caution, the possibility that such
changes will seriously undermine the value of mathematics
education cannot be lightly ignored 
(<a href="#klein">Klein and Rosen 1997</a>)</p>

<p>5 The reforms being discussed and implemented today bring
mathematics educators solidly into the realm of problems
that have been the traditional domains of statisticians and
practitioners of so-called &quot;applied
mathematics.&quot;  It is interesting to note that as late
as the early 1990s, most mathematics departments did not
encourage the practice of applied mathematics.  Few
undergraduate or graduate programs with concentrations in
applied mathematics were available.  Those that existed
were poorly funded.  Students with a primary interest in
applied mathematics were drawn instead to programs in
engineering, physics, economics, and other applied fields,
as well as to statistics.  I was one of these students. 
After completing a master's degree in mathematics at the
University of Pennsylvania in 1990, I elected to complete
graduate work in statistics at the University of Chicago,
in part because other opportunities to practice applied
mathematics were limited.</p>

<p>6 We statisticians should applaud the reform-minded
mathematicians who seek to increase the relevance of
mathematical training to their students by increasing the
applied content of their courses; however, both we and they
should be careful not to seek curricular reforms
exclusively of each other.  Mathematicians and
statisticians tend to approach the same problem in
different ways, using different sets of tools.  Both sets
of tools are relevant to problem-solving, and each approach
can inform the application of the other.  This observation
will be developed below in the context of modeling data on
the chlorosity of the IJssel lake.  Thus, it is very
important that statistics and mathematics curricular
reformers work together to instill in their students a
commitment to both sets of approaches.</p>

<h1>2. Constructionism vs. Reductionism:  An Example</h1>

<p>7 A fundamental difference in philosophy seems to
exist between current mathematical and statistical
approaches to modeling applications, although I
forthrightly admit that my observation is derived
substantially from personal experience as opposed to
rigorously collected data.  Mathematicians involved in
mathematical modeling seem to place greater emphasis on
functional forms than do statisticians.  Their
concentration is focused on the overall relationship in the
data that is to be described, and tends to exclude from
analysis the stochastic nature of the leftover deviations
of the data from the model.  Applied mathematicians are
trained to be <i>constructionists</i>, preferring the
creation of reasonable models from consideration of the
underlying science to immediate consideration of data.  On
the other hand, many statisticians today are primarily
trained to be <i>reductionists</i>, preferring to generate
a model from the observed data, perhaps illumined by a
small subset of scientific considerations, instead of dealing
with the full-scale intricacies of the underlying science. 
The data-driven approach requires that statisticians place
greater emphasis on the stochastic components of their
models, which allow a means to reasonably evaluate the
importance of deviations of the data from the model
structure.  I hypothesize that this difference in modeling
philosophy -- constructionism vs. reductionism -- is
fundamental to understanding what tools can be acquired by
students of mathematics and statistics courses,
respectively.  The exposure of an undergraduate student to
one or the other philosophy during formative undergraduate
years may have much to do with acceptance or rejection of
the &quot;statistical method.&quot;</p>

<p>8 To illustrate this difference, consider the following
example from the conference proceedings, which uses a
constructionist approach to solve a modeling problem 
(<a href="#vanherwaarden">van Herwaarden 1998</a>, pp. 299-300):</p>

<blockquote><p>A nice example illustrating the use of
differential equations concerns the effects on the
chlorosity of the IJssel-lake (the Netherlands) caused by
the construction of the Enclosure-dam.  In 1932 the
Enclosure-dam closed of [sic] the Zuiderzee (a lagoon) from
the sea.  The chlorosity of the water of the resulting
lake, named IJssel-lake, gradually decreased because of the
inflow of fresh water from the river IJssel (a branch of
the river Rhine).  The decrease of the chlorosity can be
described with the following simple model.  The IJssel-lake
contains <i>V m<sup>3</i></sup> water with chlorosity
<i>c(t)</i>, depending on the time <i>t</i> of that has
elapsed since the completion of the Enclosure-dam.  There
is an annual inflow of <i>A m<sup>3</i></sup> water from
the river IJssel with a constant chlorosity <i>a</i>, and
an annual outflow of <i>A m<sup>3</i></sup> water with
chlorosity <i>c(t)</i> through the sluices with in the
Enclosure-dam.  Assuming that the water in the IJssel-lake
is well-mixed and that other effects (like precipitation
and evaporation) cancel out, we obtain the differential
equation</p>

<center><i><p>Vc'(t) = A(a-c(t))</p></i></center>

<p>describing the rate of change of the total amount of
salt in the IJssel-lake.  Solving this equation using the
data <i>V=13x10<sup>9 </sup>m<sup>3</i></sup>,
<i>A=13x10<sup>9</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/year</i>, <i>c(0)=5.9
kg/m<sup>3</i></sup> and <i>a=0.1 kg/m<sup>3</i></sup> the
solution is obtained</p>

<center><i><p>c(t) = 0.1 + 5.8e<sup>-t</i></sup>.</p></center>

<p>In spite of the many simplifications this model very
well described the decrease of the chlorosity in the
IJssel-lake during the first year after the completion of
the Enclosure-dam.  In the second year, though, the
measured chlorosity values were higher than those
calculated with the model, see the figure.  This was due to
the very dry and warm summer of 1933, causing the rainfall
not to compensate the evaporation.  After correction for
this effect the model and the measured values were again in
good agreement.</p></blockquote>

<p>9 The author also provided the graphic shown in Figure 1 to 
illustrate the situation.</p>

<p>10 Unfortunately, the author does not present his second
and better analysis, which incorporates the effect of the
very dry and warm summer of 1933.  Instead of speculating
as to the exact form of that model based on the science,
the data are re-explored using a different analytic
perspective.  The data were first reconstructed based on a
computer scan of Figure 1 (see Table 1).</p>

<p>11 Were this problem to cross the desk of a statistician
in the context of a data analysis problem, the results of
statistical modeling might be reported as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>A nice example illustrating the use of
transformations in a regression analysis concerns the
effects on the chlorosity of the IJssel-lake (the
Netherlands) caused by the construction of the
Enclosure-dam.  In 1932 the Enclosure-dam closed off the
Zuiderzee (a lagoon) from the sea.  The chlorosity of the
water of the resulting lake, named IJssel-lake, gradually
decreased because of the inflow of fresh water from the
river IJssel (a branch of the river Rhine).</p>

<p>The relationship between chlorosity and time is
decidedly nonlinear and looks like it might be well
described by an exponential function.  We transformed the
response to the log scale, and, to enhance the
interpretability of model estimates, we also transformed the
date variable so that 6/1/32 was day 0 in our analyses. 
Initially we modeled the log of water chlorosity as a
linear function of time as follows:</p>

<center><i><p>log(c(t)) = a + bt	</i>or<i>	c(t) = C exp(bt)</i>
where <i>C = e<sup>a</i></sup>.</p></center>

<p>We generated the residual plot (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>), which
suggested that a quadratic component was missing from our
model.  Addition of a quadratic term substantially improved
the fit of our model to the data.  Inspection of fit,
residuals, and influence statistics suggested that no
further alterations to the model were necessary.  Thus, the
decrease in chlorosity can be described by the following
simple model:</p>

<center><i><p>log(c(t)) = a + bt + ct<sup>2</sup>	</i>or<i>	c(t) = 
C exp(bt+ct<sup>2</sup>)</i> where <i>C = 
e<sup>a</i></sup>.</p></center>


<p>Estimates of the parameters <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> were obtained
using a linear regression package:</p>

<hr>

<p>13 In this example, we see that the reductionist approach
to data analysis, which argues for a reasonable model based
on the observed data, may result in a better-fitting model
for these data more quickly than does the constructionist
approach.</p>

<h1>3. Discussion</h1>


<p>14 Even so, it would be inappropriate to conclude
that the statistician's modeling approach is simply
superior to that of the mathematician.  Comparisons of
effort expended by the two analysts are meaningless,
depending much more on the available assisting technology
(for example, powerful and easy to use computer software)
than on the methods.  The mathematician's analysis
communicates a better understanding of the process whereby
the water chlorosity changed than does the statistician's. 
Especially note the lack of the mathematician's additive
constant (<i>a = 0.1</i>) in the statistician's exponential
model.  Even though good science argues for the existence
of this effect, the reductionist approach would overlook it
because it is of insignificant additional importance
relative to the fit already achieved by the quadratic
exponential model.  Its insignificance is due to its
relatively small size in this particular problem; were
similar data to be collected in a situation where inflow
chlorosity were larger, say <i>a = 0.5
kg/m<sup>3</i></sup>, the effect might be much more
apparent.  Still, the mathematician comes away from this
exercise knowing that this is a necessary effect to
consider.  The statistician would have to revamp his entire
analytic approach to incorporate it because a simple log
transformation on the response to get a polynomial
expression in terms of time would not be possible in the
presence of the additional additive effect.  Instead of
being an exercise in transformation to polynomial
regression, it would require more difficult nonlinear
function fitting.</p>

<p>15 It is also evident that the statistician has greatly
benefitted from a passive knowledge of differential
equations that helps him intuit the structure of the
problem.  &quot;The relationship between chlorosity and
time is decidedly nonlinear and looks like it might be
well-described by an exponential function.&quot;  Where
does the intuition to use an exponential function come
from?  Of course, it comes from the differential equations
that describe growth and decay.  All good statisticians are
aware of the exponential nature of growth and decay
problems and immediately know to draw on the logarithm for
assistance.  In the context of regression, logarithms have
additionally good statistical properties, such as being
variance-stabilizing and reducing the influence of outlying
points on the model fit.</p>

<p>16 Now consider what the mathematician stands to gain
from the results of the statistical analysis.  Because it
is immediately evident that a quadratic term would
substantially improve on the original model, the analysis
encourages consideration of a revised differential equation
and analogous reasoning.  Again, it is hard to speculate
exactly what model was explored to account for the effects
of precipitation and evaporation.  Indeed, changes in
precipitation and evaporation may not be the only likely
culprits.  Another possibility is that the rates of inflow
and outflow, <i>A</i>, are decreasing over time, a
reasonable possibility if dry weather were having a
prolonged effect on the inflow.  Over this relatively short
period of time, this change in rate might be approximated
by a linear term, and thus one can obtain the revised
differential equation</p>

<center><i><p>Vc'(t) = (A-Dt)(a-c(t))</p></center>

</i><p>where the constant <i>D</i> reflects the decrease in
the inflow and outflow currents.  This differential
equation would lead to the quadratic exponential form
uncovered in the statistical analysis, with an additional
constant added outside the exponent.</p>

<p>17 Although modifications that would improve the fit of a
model to these data are easy to uncover and explore in this
simple example, the process might be much more difficult in
less well-understood modeling situations. Without the
statistician's approach to draw on, it might be less
evident what steps are needed to better understand the
deviations of a hypothesized model from the observed data. 
Arguably the most important skill taught in statistical
training is that the deviations of the data from a model
are often more important than the model itself.  It is
likely that this style of thinking is currently
under-emphasized in the mathematics curriculum.</p>

<p>18 There is much to lose if mathematicians and
statisticians do not partner in reforms of their individual
curricula.  Mathematicians may fail at substantially
increasing the applied relevance of mathematical training. 
I base this fear on an observation drawn from attendance at
the Samos conference, that the new emphasis on mathematical
modeling belied a general lack of statistical awareness
among the participants.  A corresponding lack of
statistical awareness in mathematical pedagogy would be a
serious omission.  In Samos, I was struck by the absence of
practices that statisticians would consider mandatory.  For
example, evaluations of changes to teaching protocols or
materials were mostly presented in raw numerical form,
without so much as a t-test to help evaluate the nature of
differences observed between study groups.  In one session
I suggested that a randomized controlled clinical trial
design would be appropriate to evaluate the effectiveness
of a new computer-based lesson plan.  I was left speechless
when a serious-minded gentleman responded that he did not
believe in the results of clinical trials.  Examples of
mathematical models for various observable data were
presented in multiple sessions.  Few of these had
stochastic components in them, and their evaluation did not
include analyses of the deviations of the data from the
models.  When stochastic models were used, the
probabilistic nature of these models remained mostly
hidden. (I observed this multiple times in the case of
models using Markov chains.)  Thus, I found myself
questioning the relevance of a certain pedagogical method,
which does not seek to illuminate the nature of stochastic
randomness in applied problems, for instructing students in
techniques for modeling observable phenomena.</p>

<p>19 For mathematical pedagogy, the implications of the
IJssel lake example are clear.  As with the study of
statistics, mathematics can expose students to models of a
wide variety of observable phenomena, to offer them a
broader experience base than is available in other academic
programs.  In this context, the field of mathematics can
best contribute to students' understanding of model
structures, but it should be careful not to do so by
tossing out the useful paradigm of stochasticity
altogether.  Also, many have observed that beginning
students have a difficult time building constructionist
models on their own.  A greater sensitivity to reductionist
tools might help students grasp difficult modeling
principles more easily.</p> 

<p>20 Contrarily, statistical training should focus more on
the issues that determine model relationships, and less on
the stochastic components that, at best, simply serve as
useful means to probe a model's weaknesses.  It is a common
observation among statisticians with mathematical
backgrounds that most recently graduated non-Ph.D.
statisticians lack the skills needed to construct
functional model relationships, and we wonder whether our
reliance on data-oriented thinking may be somewhat
misplaced.  There are few situations where a nonparametric
model would be superior to an equally well-performing
functional one that reflects scientific principles.</p>

<p>21 Truly what is needed is a hybrid pedagogical approach,
that would seek to empower students with the tools to look
at modeling problems from many angles.  Mathematicians and
statisticians should be encouraged to partner with
colleagues in applied fields in order to provide students
with effective, multidisciplinary training environments. 
This can be done at the university level through
mathematics-across-the-curriculum initiatives, in which
students of many fields acquire mathematical skills
simultaneously with and in the context of their chosen
studies.  Smaller, more focused initiatives can also be
successful.  To the extent that applications enter
mathematics and statistics coursework, individual faculty
need to be sensitive to issues of analytic perspective as
well.  A reviewer suggested that mathematics faculty who
are receptive to statistical ideas can take short courses
offered by the Mathematical Association of America in
conjunction with the American Statistical Association. 
These courses are directed especially at mathematicians who
find themselves in the position of teaching statistics with
no formal statistical training.  The author is unaware of
initiatives designed to communicate to statisticians the
perspectives and methods of applied mathematicians. 
Perhaps the Institute of Mathematical Statistics should
consider sponsoring such opportunities.</p>

<p>22 At the University of South Florida (USF), we are
constructing a pilot interdisciplinary center that will
focus on creation and application of techniques for the
mathematical and statistical Modeling of Image-related Data
Across the Sciences (MIDAS).  MIDAS brings together
researchers from across USF with interests in quantitative
biology.  Partnership with undergraduate and graduate
programs across USF provides students with important
multidisciplinary support and training opportunities in
areas of growing importance to health research.  One of our
goals is to design a for-credit, multidisciplinary,
bioinformatics internship at Moffitt that teaches students
to model image-related data from many perspectives, thereby
serving the needs of multiple academic programs.  MIDAS
also sponsors a multidisciplinary mathematical-modeling
lecture series that seeks to enhance both research and
learning environments.  Faculty from across USF with
expertise in mathematics, imaging, computer science,
bioengineering, biology, medicine, bioinformatics, and
statistics participate in center activities.  Multiple USF
departments, as well as collaborative studies and programs
of the Moffitt Cancer Center, are represented.</p>

<p>23 Regardless of the cooperative mechanism chosen, one
should strive to show students that there may be benefits
to approaching the same analytic problem from multiple
perspectives, and to give them experience in doing so. 
Such experience may help students better understand the
relevance of quantitative fields to the bigger picture of
their own educational direction and goals.  Perhaps
departments of mathematics and statistics will need to
adopt a new spirit of cooperation if curricular
enhancements in either environment are to have a reasonable
chance at long-term success.</p>
