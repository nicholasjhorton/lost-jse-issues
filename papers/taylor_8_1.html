<p><strong>Key Words:</strong> Examinations;
Microcomputer task based testing; 
Student performance evaluation. 


</p><h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Given the emphasis on utilizing the computer in many
statistics courses, we discuss how we have
implemented microcomputer task based testing in our
courses.  Background information is provided about a
required, undergraduate, multiple section course, and why
we believe computer-based testing is an effective
evaluation instrument.  Issues of examination design,
administration, and evaluation are presented.  Examples of
problems used in computer-based exams are also included.
</p>

<h1>1. Introduction and Background</h1>

<p>1 At the California State University, Sacramento (CSUS),
College of Business Administration, the analysis and model
building phases of our data analysis courses are done with
microcomputer software.  This is the standard practice in
most universities and industry as well.  In class, the
instructor uses a microcomputer with projection equipment
to interactively build models and to explain the theory and
practice of model building.  After class, the students use
microcomputers to work on homework assignments and
projects.  Because students are exposed to interactive
model building with microcomputers in lecture classes, use
microcomputers to interactively build models for homework
and projects, and will be expected to do the same in their
careers, it is a natural extension to allow students to use
the microcomputer hardware and software to aid their work
during exams.  This paper presents the current status and
thinking at CSUS College of Business Administration on the
experience of allowing students to use microcomputers and
statistical software to aid their analysis on exams.</p>

<p>2 We wish to note that the term "microcomputer
task based testing" is used in this paper to indicate that
a computer and software are used interactively to aid a
student's analysis by performing routine statistical
calculations.  The exam is written by the instructor and is
provided to the student in printed paper form.  The data
for the exam are on a disk in a suitable file.  The student
must supply the intelligence, knowledge, and creativity to
perform the analysis and write the answers. The
microcomputer hardware and software are tools used to
execute standard statistical calculations.  The instructor
must still grade the exam, based upon the student's written
analysis.  Students turn in their disks in case
there is a question about their data file(s) once the exams
are returned to the students.</p>

<p>3 Although this paper deals primarily with "microcomputer
task based testing" in a data analysis course, the same
approach can be and is used in other academic fields that
require extensive calculation, model building, or 
software-aided data manipulation.  Examples of other
academic fields that are currently using this testing
approach at the CSUS College of Business Administration are
management science, investment portfolio management,
computer literacy, database, and programming courses.</p>

<p>4 In this paper we initially discuss the goals of the
course, Data Analysis for Managers, in which we use
microcomputer task based testing.  The following sections
discuss the rationale for our testing procedures, the
design of the examinations, the administration of the
examinations, and the grading procedures.  In the final 
two sections we provide examples of the problems we have
used and a conclusion.</p>

<h1>2. Course Goals</h1>

<p>5 Using many of the recommendations cited in "Making
Statistics More Effective in Schools of Business" (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064038/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/taylor.cfm#easton">Easton, Roberts, and Tiao
1988</a>), we have designed and implemented a course that
places a heavy emphasis on students' learning to think
intuitively about statistics and being able to communicate
their research findings to colleagues who have strong
statistical backgrounds.  The stated course objectives are
for students to (1) develop an intuitive feel for
statistical techniques; (2) learn to use statistical
software and interpret computer output; and (3) learn to
apply and convey the results of advanced business-applied
statistical techniques in managerial decision-making
situations.  Our first objective implies that we teach
sound statistical theory and reasoning without rigorous
mathematical proofs or notation.</p>

<p>6 The foundation for our approach is based on the
recommendations of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064038/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/taylor.cfm#roberts">Roberts
(1991)</a>. We develop the course by introducing the
concepts of specific and common variation, discussing
control charts, and then progressing into the major
component of model building.  The primary vehicle used is
multiple regression with the major emphasis placed on
economic time series data obtained via the Internet.</p>

<p>7 To evaluate the students' comprehension of the class
material, we use a number of instruments, including
microcomputer task based testing, case analysis homework,
and a research project.  We will discuss our computer-based
analysis testing procedures. </p>

<h1>3. Conventional Evaluation Methods in a Data Analysis Course</h1>

<p>8 Traditional methods of evaluation in a data analysis
course include</p>

<ol type="1">
<p></p><li>Homework scores, for both written and computer assignments,<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Projects and papers, and<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Conventional exams with short-answer questions
(multiple choice, true and false, or matching), short
essays, problems requiring calculation with pencil and
paper or calculator, and analysis of computer
printouts.<p></p>

</li></ol>

<p>9 Homework scores may be a real indication of knowledge
and skill.  Ideally, homework assignments can be a very
valid way to measure achievement.  If students can use a
computer, software, statistical theory, heuristic rules,
and modest amounts of judgment to analyze and model data in
the support of business decisions, then they have satisfied
the goals of our course.  Realistically, there are several
flaws in this type of measurement.  First, there is the
issue of academic honesty.  It is very easy to copy all or
part of an assignment requiring computer analysis and
models. It is hard to detect anything but obvious,
unmodified duplication.  It is also difficult to detect
collaboration and ensure that each student can and did
perform the required analysis and modeling.  Besides,
collaboration and cooperation are valid learning strategies
for homework and should be encouraged to some extent.  
Second, there is the issue of time, because homework is not
restricted in terms of time and there is some expectation
of productivity in addition to correctness.  Third,
extensive homework assignments may be expensive in terms of
instructor time.  For these reasons, homework has a
marginal role in measuring performance in our data analysis
course.</p>

<p>10 Papers and projects are very valuable academic
assignments but suffer the same benefits and drawbacks as
homework assignments.  Ideally, they are very good tools
and are required in our course, but realistically they are
not practical as the sole measures for large numbers of
undergraduate students.</p>

<p>11 Conventional exams using the above mentioned
methods are acceptable for measuring knowledge of concepts
and facts.  But the key elements in our data analysis course
are analysis and modeling of datasets.  Conventional exams
with paper and pencil or calculator problems are impossible
due to the extensive calculation burden for any realistic
problem(s).  In addition, our emphasis on analysis and
modeling instead of number crunching makes this type of
problem almost irrelevant.</p> 

<p>12 Conventional exams that present realistic and complex
datasets with computer-generated output are useful and
valid testing methods for our course.  However, these are
static situations with no feedback mechanism for student
decisions.  They are essentially cross-sectional snapshots
of an analysis and modeling process.  A student may be able
to correctly answer many cross-sectional situations but
lack the ability to deal with earlier or later stages of
the analysis.  In other words, he or she may not be able to
put the entire process together into a complete analysis
and modeling process and may be incapable of actually
completing an analysis.  While valuable, cross-sectional,
static snapshots of analysis and modeling issues are not
completely valid for measuring the skills and knowledge
that are the key goals of our course.</p>

<p>13 We have come to realize that what is needed is a
longitudinal instrument capable of measuring the entire
analysis and modeling process, including the decision
feedback mechanisms, heuristic judgment issues, and the
syntactical computer software skills. We believe
that the data analysis and modeling process is analogous to
skills like driving a car and flying a plane.  Testing for
concepts, facts, and isolated skills is not enough to
infer that an individual can drive a car or fly a plane.  A
real life demonstration of skill in driving or flying is
required to issue a license.  To complete our analogy, we
believe that students should actually analyze and model
limited, but realistic, datasets during an exam. </p>

<h1>4. Microcomputer Task Based Testing</h1>

<p>14 One of the testing methods used in our data
analysis course is a microcomputer task based test.  The
students are given a printed exam and a data disk that
includes the required datasets.  The exams are held in a
computer lab so that each student has a computer and the
required software (StatGraphics).  The printed exams give a
brief scenario for the datasets, questions that have to be
answered, and space for the students to write their
answers.  We believe that this gives us a
longitudinal instrument that measures how well the student
responds throughout the problem analysis.  The entire
modeling process is documented in the student's write-up,
including heuristic judgment issues and diagnostics.</p> 

<p>15 One of the course elements that make this type of
testing possible is the Electronic Lecture Classroom in
which the course is held.  In this classroom there is an
instructor's workstation and projector that shows a screen
image on a large motion picture screen on the left front of
the classroom.  This allows simultaneous use of the
computer, transparencies on another screen, and the
whiteboard.  The instructors step through the data analysis
and modeling process live, with the computer, software, and
instructor's interaction all visible to the students.  The
students see the analysis, the syntactical software
details, and the computer output as the instructor does the
analysis.  Because the software license allows all students
to have a copy of the software, this is the same process
that they can work at home or at most of the university's
personal computers.  Little instruction on the syntactical
details of the software is necessary because they are
demonstrated in class throughout the semester.  The exams
are held in another room, a computer lab with one machine
per student.  On the exam, the students are asked to
perform similar analysis and modeling tasks with the same
software and computers.</p>

<p>16 For those instructors who do not have computer
demonstration equipment in their classrooms, but can give
exams in a computer lab, microcomputer task based testing
is still possible.  Computer screens can be printed on
overhead projector transparencies and the entire analysis
and modeling process shown to the class as the instructor
lectures.  This approach can work, but it does not show the
syntactical aspects as well.  Nor does it allow for some
spontaneous explorations in response to a student
question or request.  However, transparencies do avoid the
necessity of the instructor's lecturing and using the
keyboard and mouse at the same time.  Instructors who are
not accustomed to doing live software demonstrations may
find that transparencies are a faster and more error-free
approach.  However, our informal feedback from instructors
and students is that live software demonstrations are
strongly preferred. </p>  

<h1>5. Design of Exams</h1>

<p>17 The design of the examination requires that the
students demonstrate the ability to analyze data using a
computer and software.  Each problem will need to use
either real data or simulated data.  Because of many
practical constraints, it has been our experience that
using simulated data on exams has some advantages over
using real data.  The College of Business Administration
offers 10 to 15 sections of the Data Analysis course each
semester, and a single instructor may have sections
separated by most of a day.  This is enough time for an
early section's students to brief a later section's
students.  The usual approach to frustrate a student who
has been thoroughly briefed and who intends to take the
exam by rote playback of his or her briefing is to have
different versions of the same exam.  It is difficult to do
this with real data.  In addition, the exam is limited in
time, usually only 75 minutes, and the problem or problems
must be such that they can be reasonably analyzed and
written up in this time period.  Real data must be
carefully selected to meet such a time limit.  Further,
because exams are given at intervals in the semester, not
all topics are covered before each exam.  Care must be
taken that the datasets reflect only topics covered in
lectures before the exam and not have specific variations
that cannot be explained or modeled with the students'
current set of tools or techniques.  We have used both real
and simulated data for exams, and reasonable, fair, and
challenging exams can be designed either way.  One approach
is to use simulated data for earlier, more specific, exams
and real data for later, more comprehensive,
exams.</p>      

<p>18 The generation of datasets is a fairly simple
process. The statistical software package we use is
StatGraphics Plus for Windows  (version 3.1); however, most
statistical packages have similar capabilities.  In
particular, we generate the data using a random number
generator for different distributions.  The most common
distributions we use to generate data are the normal and
discrete uniform distributions.  Then, through arithmetic
operations, we are able to construct conditions that can be
used to approximate situations business practitioners may
encounter.</p>

<p>19 One of the nice features of using simulated data is
that one can use the same scenario in different versions of
the exam, modifying the simulation model (changing numbers,
switching variable names, ...)  so that there are different
problems (and solutions).   We have done this even from one
semester to the next, while giving out the previous
semester's exam as a study guide. </p>

<h1>6. Administration of Exams</h1>

<p>20 In contrast to multiple choice exams, the
administration of microcomputer task based testing is much
more difficult and critical to the success of the
examination itself.  There are two major elements -- the
computer and the data files.  It sounds simple enough, but
when students sit down to analyze data on the computer for
an exam, their anxiety levels increase so that even the
simplest computer malfunction becomes magnified.  To help
reduce these kinds of problems, we have found it helpful
for the instructor and/or assistants to go around prior to
the exam to make sure that the computers are working
properly and that the required software is set for each
station.  This setting up involves making sure that the
computers are stand-alone, i.e., not networked together, to prevent e-mail messages from being transmitted during
the examinations.  Because we want to prevent "networking"
environments, the data files for the exams need to be
distributed in the form of diskettes.</p>  

<p>21 Even with the precautions set out above, problems will
occur from time to time.  Hence we have found it helpful to
keep a few computers in reserve and to include a couple of
non-computer questions on the exams so that a student who
experiences some "down time" can still work on the exam. 
In the event of a computer problem, the test administrator
can resolve the problem, minimizing the likelihood that the
student will blame the computer or software for his or her
poor performance.</p>

<p>22 Another useful technique is to give a practice exam. 
We have done this, and the student feedback is
very positive.  We have given a previous semester's exam in
the same room and under the same conditions as the real
exam, except that we answer questions, assist students,
and let students help each other.  The noise level goes up,
and the instructor may end up running all over helping
students.  The students are busy explaining things and
showing syntactical tips to each other and learning.  This
practice helps reduce the anxiety that some students have
when dealing with this type of exam.</p>

<p>23 One final administrative detail is that we require the
students to turn in their data disks with their exams. 
Each disk has an unique number that the student records
on the written exam.   This, along with using stand-alone
(non-networked) computers with write-protected hard
drives, prevents the dissemination of the data to additional
sections of students.  Collecting the disks can also aid in
the grading of examinations.  A student may come up with an
unusual model, and the grader may need to examine the
residuals to evaluate the model or check to see if the
student entered data correctly.  For example, a student may
have made a data entry error entering time, seasonal, or
intervention variables.  These errors can be identified to
ensure that proper credit is awarded. </p>

<h1>7. Grading Examinations</h1>

<p>24 The type of exam being discussed here is much more
difficult and time consuming to grade than exams where
there is only one correct answer per problem.  It is
possible for students to have various results on a
particular problem and still obtain full credit because we
are more interested in the students' thought processes than
whether their answers are "correct."</p>

<p>25 To implement the evaluation process, the instructor
frequently needs to replicate a student's analysis on a
computer.  For example, if the students are provided with a
dataset and asked to construct a regression model (see
Examples 1-3 below), there are a number of different
approaches that may be taken, each resulting in equivalent
models.  To ascertain whether a particular model
is equivalent (to the instructor's), it may be necessary for
the instructor (evaluator) to work through the student's
analysis.  Did the student evaluate the residuals?  Are
all of the variables in the model significant?</p>

<p>26 Of course, being able to replicate a student's
analysis requires that the student carefully document his
or her work.  Hence, all of our exams declare in the
instructions that the student needs to SHOW ALL OF YOUR
WORK.  We stress ahead of time, when going over exams from
previous semesters (practice exams), that what we mean by
SHOW ALL OF YOUR WORK is that we want to see written on the
exam the thought process and not the individual key
strokes. </p>

<h1>8. Examples of Exam Questions</h1>

<p>27 In this section, we provide three sample exam
questions, each based on simulated data. The datasets for
the three examples are provided in two formats.  The file
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064038/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/examples.xls">examples.xls</a> is an Excel file
containing all three datasets.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064038/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/cd.txt">cd.txt</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064038/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tz.txt">tz.txt</a>, and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064038/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/zi.txt">zi.txt</a> are text files containing the
three individual datasets.</p>

<h2>Example 8.1</h2>

<p>28 Herr Andes Luthi owns a bank in Bern, Switzerland. 
One of Herr Luthi's requirements of his employees is that
they must continually solicit unnumbered accounts from
foreign investors.  Herr Luthi prefers to call such
accounts "CD" because they have time limits similar to
certificates of deposits used in the United States.</p>

<p>29 Being very computer literate, Herr Luthi created a
file, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064038/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/cd.txt">cd.txt</a>, to store his data.  In
his historical file, he maintains monthly data on  volume
(the sales volume of CDs),  call (the number of cold calls
Herr Luthi's employees made each month during the period
November 1992 through April 1998), rate (the average rate
for a CD), and mail (the number of mailings Herr Luthi sent
out to potential customers).  Because of the excellent
services provided by the bank, it is the norm for customers
to roll over their CDs into new CDs when their original CDs
expire.</p>

<p>30 It should be noted that several years ago Herr
Luthi took many of his employees on an extended ski
vacation.  Records show that the ski vacation lasted from
December 1994 through the end of March 1995.  The few
non-skiers, who opted to take their holidays in Spain,
continued soliciting CDs.  They were, of course, credited
with any walk-in traffic and any roll-over accounts.</p>

<p>31 You were recently offered a position at Herr Luthi's
bank.  As part of your responsibilities, you are to
construct a regression model that can be used to analyze
the bank's performance with regard to selling CDs.  When
the Board of Directors last met, they projected the
following for May 1998: </p>

<p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Number of Cold Calls</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	 
<td>900</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Average Rate for a CD</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	 
<td>3.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Number of mailings</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>      
<td>4,500</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>

<ol type="a">
<p></p><li>You are to construct an appropriate regression model
which you will  use to forecast sales volume for May 1998. <p></p>

<p></p></li><li>How effective are the cold calls  (call)?<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>How sensitive is volume to changes in interest rates
(rate)?<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Is there any kind of "roll over" effect?<p></p>
</li></ol>


<h2>Example 8.2</h2>

<p>32 The marketing department for TZ Inc. has been
struggling with how they will spend their advertising
budget in the coming year.  As an outside consultant, you
have been requested to make a recommendation.  You have
been provided the monthly values for net sales (sales) and
advertising expenditures for radio (radio), paper (paper),
and television (tv), along with their sum (total = radio +
paper + tv), in the file <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064038/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/tz.txt">tz.txt</a>,
covering the months from April 1990  through December
1997.  Your assignment is to evaluate the effectiveness of
each of the advertising components (radio, paper, and
television) with regard to net sales.</p>

<ol type="a">

<p></p><li>Develop a forecasting equation for net sales. (State
your equation in the form <i>Y<sub>t</sub> = b<sub>0</sub>
+ b<sub>1</sub>  X<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub> 
X<sub>2</sub> + b<sub>3</sub> X<sub>3</sub> +
···)</i><p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Describe the procedures you used to determine the
recommended forecasting equation.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>What is your recommendation regarding where (what
media) to spend advertising dollars?<p></p>
</li></ol>

<h2>Example 8.3</h2>

<p>33 In the file <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307064038/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n1/zi.txt">zi.txt</a> reside
variables that represent monthly financial data for ZI's
Pizza, a restaurant located in South Natomas.  The data
cover the months from June 1994 through April 1998.  The
variables represented are</p>

<p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>sales:</td>    
<td>gross sales</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nnews:</td>  
<td>amount of advertising spent in <i>The Natomas News</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bee:</td>  
<td>amount of advertising spent in <i>The Sacramento Bee</i></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>

<p>34 When questioned about significant events that affected
their sales, Kas Ziegler, the manager, stated that a
competitor opened up business in the same general location
starting in December 1995, but stayed open only until
November 1996.</p>

<ol type="a">
<p></p><li>Construct a regression model to explain the
source(s) of specific  variation in sales for ZI's Pizza.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Predict the sales for May 1998, assuming that there
will be $450 spent on advertising in <i>The Sacramento
Bee</i> and $350 spent advertising in <i>The Natomas
News</i>.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>What financial impact did the competitor have on
gross sales for ZI's Pizza?<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Which advertising source is more effective for ZI's
Pizza, <i>The Natomas News</i> or <i>The Sacramento Bee</i>?<p></p>

</li></ol>


<h1>9. Concluding Comments</h1>

<p>35 We believe that for computer-based statistics
courses, any examination designed to determine whether a
student has the ability to think statistically should
include a component that allows students to interact with a
computer.  In discussions with colleagues at other
institutions, we have been surprised by the fact that very
few instructors use computer-based testing like that
described here.  We hope that this article provides enough
information for those who want to try this approach to get
started. </p>
