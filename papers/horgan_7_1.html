<h2>                          Abstract</h2>

<p>         The statistical power of an experiment is a subtle
         idea that is difficult to explain to a
         non-statistician, and yet it is fundamental to the
         design of scientific experiments.  We have
         developed some spreadsheets that have been useful
         in illustrating the ideas by simulation.  These
         allow scientists to simulate situations using
         parameters similar to what they expect in their own
         work, and to explore the effect of experimental
         variability.  Our examples are available on the
         World Wide Web.</p>



                          <h1>1.  Introduction</h1>


<p>1    Perhaps the greatest difficulty in presenting statistical
     ideas is the need to consider simultaneously variation and
     uncertainty at many levels.  In a classical comparative
     experiment, we need to have in mind the variation in the
     variables observed as well as variation in the potential
     sets of results plausible under different scenarios or
     hypotheses.  We must also accept the uncertainty, expressed
     via confidence or Bayesian posterior probabilities, in the
     conclusions of an experiment.  When designing an experiment,
     there is added to these a consideration of the variation
     among potential experimental conclusions, relative to what
     the truth might be.  This comes naturally to those
     accustomed to thinking statistically, but presents a
     substantial obstacle to others.

<p>2    At Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland, we regularly
     provide scientists with help and training in experimental
     design.  A fundamental question in any experimental planning
     is that of sample size.  This is usually addressed via some
     sort of power calculation.  In explaining what this
     involves, the difficulties of multiple levels of variation
     inevitably arise.  In our experience, confusion about the
     different roles of the significance level and the power of
     the experiment, and their association to observational
     variability and number, is inevitable.  This continual need
     to explain these concepts has led us to exploit the power of
     spreadsheets to simulate experimental situations.

<p>3    The wide availability and ease of use of spreadsheets for
     data handling has attracted wide interest in their use in
     statistical education (<a href="#elliott">Elliott and Starkings 1994<a/>, <a href="#hunt1">Hunt
     1994)</a>.  They now form an integral part of many statistics
     courses (see, for example, <a href="#fillebrown">Fillebrown 1994</a>; <a href="#hall">Hall 1995)</a>.
     Their uses are discussed by <a href="#hunt2">Hunt (1996)</a> and <a href="#currall">Currall (1996)</a>.
     They are considered in the context of other tools for
     students learning statistics by <a href="#ludbrook">Ludbrook (1995)</a>.  A page of
     resources is maintained at URL <a href="gate/horganlink1.html">http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/assume/files/</a>.

<p>4    Our experience indicates that their main advantages are

<ul>
      <li>They come with a well-developed easy-to-use interface.
<p>

      <li>Scientists are usually already familiar with
         spreadsheets, using them for data entry and
         manipulation.
<p>

      <li>Course participants seem to expect that statistics will
         be less frightening and intimidating when conducted in
         the environment of a spreadsheet.  As a result, they
         are more likely to sign up for courses.
</ul>

<p>5    Against these must be set the main disadvantage:


<ul>      <li>Although adequate for teaching and doing basic
         statistical analyses, the abilities of spreadsheets are
         severely limited.  There is a danger that scientists
         with data requiring more complex analyses will persist
         in using spreadsheets when more specialist statistics
         programs are appropriate.  Some statistics programs can
         be configured to act as extra menus in a spreadsheet,
         and this may help alleviate the problem.
</ul>

<p>     A good review of these, and other, advantages and
     disadvantages is given by <a href="#nash">Nash and Quon (1996)</a>.

<p>6    We illustrate our use of spreadsheets with two examples.
     The first is intended to help explain the idea of
     experimental power, and to convince scientists of the
     reality of experimental variability.  The second does the
     same in a more complex situation, where analytical
     evaluation of experimental variation is intractable.  These
     spreadsheets do not provide power calculation, only
     demonstration.  For calculation, students are referred to
     tables or other computer programs.  It has recently been
     argued (<a href="#gatti">Gatti and Harwell 1998</a>) that such programs are
     easier for students than tables or charts, and our
     experience supports this.



       <h1>2.  Spreadsheet for the Power of the Two-Sample
       t-Test</h1>


<p>7    The basic idea of experimental power can best be illustrated
     in the case of the two-sample comparative experiment, which
     leads to an analysis by a Student's t-test.  The spreadsheet
     illustrated in Figure 1 was developed in Microsoft Excel.
     It shows all the parts of the experiment, including the
     &quot;truth,&quot; the experimental data, the analysis and a diagram.

     Experiment.
</p>


<hr>

<p> 8    This spreadsheet is intended to illustrate the concepts of
      experimental power to scientists working on animal
      nutrition, and so the experimental units are referred to as
      animals, and the two groups as control and treated.  This
      can very easily be changed.  The spreadsheet allows rapid
      exploration of the effect of changing experimental
      parameters:


<ul>
       <li>The simulation can be repeated as often as wished by
          pressing a single function key.  Updating appears
          instantaneous.
<p>
       <li>The &quot;truth&quot; (control and treatment means and standard
          deviations) can be changed.
<p>

       <li>The number of animals is easily changed by selecting
          and dragging with the mouse.
</ul>

<p> 9    Instructions are provided on the spreadsheet.  This is an
      environment with which scientists will be familiar, as it is
      the usual way for experimental data to be entered and
      manipulated.  It is also used for straightforward
      statistical analyses.  Users can easily customise the
      spreadsheet by changing not only the experimental parameters
      but also the descriptions, the reference to animals, and the
      appearance of the chart.



               <h1>3.  Exploring a Dose-Response Experiment</h1>


<p>10    The issue in the comparative experiment illustrated above
      was fairly simple:  Does the treatment have an effect?  The
      spreadsheet shown in Figure 2 addresses a more complex
      question.

<a name="Figure2"></p>

<p>
<a href="horgan02.gif"><img src="/web/20130307064603im_/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v7n1/horgan02.icon.gif" width="278" height="195">Figure 2 (18K gif)</a> </p>

<p>Figure 2.  Simulation of a Dose-Response Experiment.</p>


<hr>

<p>11    Here, animals are given infusions of different amounts of a
      compound, and its effect on blood metabolites is studied.
      There is interest in the dose-response curve.  The issue of
      whether this is linear or sigmoid is one question to be
      examined in an experiment.  However, it is not clear whether
      the modest number of animals to be used means that the data
      will allow this to be resolved.  Trying to answer this
      analytically would be very demanding.  The spreadsheet
      allows the effect of differing sample sizes, likely response
      levels, and between-animal variability to be explored in an
      interactive way.  These parameters can be easily changed,
      and the experiment repeated many times by pressing a
      function key.  With only a little more effort, additional
      dose levels can be added, or existing ones deleted.



                 <h1>4.  Construction of the Spreadsheets</h1>


<p>12    The construction of these spreadsheets makes use of two of
      their most powerful features:  the ability of cells to
      contain formulae referring to other cells, and automatic
      updating when these are changed.  The use of the &quot;fill
      handle,&quot; whereby a formula in cells can be extended to other
      cells, is very useful, both for creating the spreadsheets,
      and as a tool to allow the user to change the sample size.
      Data were simulated using the uniform random number
      generator and the normal inverse function, scaled by the
      content of the &quot;truth&quot; cells.  The analysis was constructed
      using appropriate formulae, and the charts based on the
      analysis and data summary.



                            <h1>5.  Discussion</h1>


<p>13    The spreadsheets are used in classroom teaching and
      one-to-one consultancy discussions.  For classroom
      situations, where the concept of power is being explained,
      the t-test spreadsheet is used.  It is preceded by an
      explanation, along traditional lines, of the power of an
      experiment:  Type I and type II errors are introduced, and
      the interdependence of the test significance level,
      experimental power, true biological response, and sample
      size described.  Tables for doing these calculations are
      offered.  Usually it becomes apparent that too many abstract
      ideas are being presented for most of the audience to feel
      they understand it.  Asking if anyone can say what, for
      example, &quot;90% power&quot; is quantifying does not produce any
      good answers.  At this point, the spreadsheet is introduced
      as a way of illustrating power.  Participants are then
      invited to experiment with it (in a classroom with PCs), and
      encouraged to try adapting the &quot;truth&quot; to values plausible
      in their own experimental work.  Discussing the simulations
      with participants as they do this makes it clear that
      understanding has much improved.

<p>14    The dose-response spreadsheet is an example of one that
      would be useful in a consultancy discussion where a
      scientist is seeking help in designing a new experiment,
      where the power calculations involved are not easily pursued
      using available tables or computer programs.  Scientists
      generally say they find the spreadsheets helpful in
      appreciating the extent of experimental variability, and the
      meaning of statistical power.  It is not unusual for there
      to be some dismay that their intended experimental size
      (limited by cost) will only be able to detect quite large
      responses.  A common additional comment is something along
      the lines that they would make it very easy to fake the
      data!
