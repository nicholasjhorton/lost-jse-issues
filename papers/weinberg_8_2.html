<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Five case studies based on real situations and real
data are presented for use in courses on research
methodology and data analysis.  Departing from the
typical case study approach, students are asked to act as
consultants to resolve the issues placed before them, prior
to being given a solution.  In generic terms, students are
given a description of a real problem and a real dataset
relevant to solving that problem and are asked for their
advice on how the problem may be solved.  This approach
motivates students to take ownership of the problem at hand
and provides them with the opportunities and experiences to
use the tools of their education actively, rather than to
merely acquire them.</p>

<h1>1.  Introduction</h1>

<p>1 The topic of teaching effectiveness at the university
level has received  much attention in recent years.  At New
York University (NYU), for example, the administration has
charged its Educational Policies Committee with the task of
defining teacher effectiveness and of creating
opportunities at the university for its enhancement.</p>

<p>2 Of course, concerns about teaching effectiveness must,
by definition, be  linked to concerns about student
learning.  Quite simply, for teachers to be  effective they
must provide experiences and opportunities for students to
reach  the goals they have set for them.</p>

<p>3 Although particular goals will vary from course to
course and from year to year,  many researchers have argued
that, as teachers, we must direct students to develop 
confidence in their skills to use knowledge in order to
expand their thinking and  learning and to solve problems
independently (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#baron">Baron and Sternberg

They have also 
argued that in accordance with these goals, students must
view knowledge as a set of  tools to be applied in
meaningful ways, rather than as inert and arbitrary
procedures  or facts to be memorized (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#bransforda">Bransford and McCarrell 1974</a>;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#dewey">Dewey 1910</a>).  Based on a  discussion by
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#whitehead">Whitehead (1929)</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#vandy">Cognition and Technology Group at
Vanderbilt  University (1990)</a> defines inert knowledge
as "knowledge that can usually be recalled  when
people are explicitly asked to do so but is not used
spontaneously in problem  solving even though it is
relevant" (p. 2).</p>

<p>4 Many of us who are involved in teaching research
methodology and data analysis agree  on the importance of
providing our students with opportunities and experiences
that give  them the confidence and skill to solve problems
independently.  As such, we believe that  inert knowledge
is not useful knowledge.  Our challenge is to find ways of
presenting  information to our students so that it is
accessible, relevant, applicable, and even vital  to their
own areas of interest.</p>

<p>5 One approach that has been used successfully by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#vandy">Cognition and Technology Group at 
Vanderbilt (1990)</a>, and that we have been using
independently in our own classes, is to  create situations
that permit students to understand the kinds of problems
that experts  in the field encounter as consultants and to
also understand the knowledge that consultants  use as
tools for solving these problems.  Because this approach
anchors instruction in the  context of authentic,
problem-solving tasks, it is a form of what is called
anchored  instruction.  Anchored instruction has been found
to provide a more meaningful and stimulating  learning
experience than the more traditional, fact-oriented
approach (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#adams">Adams et al. 1988</a>;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#lockhart">Lockhart, Lamon, and Glick 1988</a>).</p>

<p>6 The use of real data has been advocated for quite some
time to enhance student learning  in courses on data
analysis and design (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#goldman">Goldman 1996</a>; 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#singer">Singer and Willett 1990</a>;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#wilson">Wilson 1992</a>).   As consultants and as
consumers of the literature and media, we are  exposed to a
wealth of real problems and data to bring to the classroom
to serve as case  studies for students to analyze and
solve. When asked to solve a real problem based  on real
data that is relevant to them, students become motivated
to  take ownership of the problem and to apply their
problem-solving skills and knowledge base  in an active way
to reach a solution.  By linking general principles to real
problems that  experts face as consultants and as
consumers, we send a strong message to our  students that
such principles are relevant, applicable, and vital tools
of our trade.</p>

<p>7 In this paper we present five case studies that are
either  based on real problems we have faced as consultants
ourselves or on real data that is publicly available to
exemplify general principles commonly taught in courses  on
research design and data analysis.  We depart from the
typical way in which case studies  are presented in
classrooms by the fact that we ask each student to act as a
consultant to  resolve the issues placed before him.   Like
the consultant, each student is expected to  resolve the
problem presented <i>prior to being told how it was
solved</i>.  Like  the consulting situation, questions are
posed in a more general and diffuse form.  In generic 
terms, we describe the problem to students, give them a
real dataset that we believe is  relevant to solving the
problem and ask them for their advice on how the problem
may be  solved.  We ask each student to work independently
to arrive at a solution.  A more directed  approach might
ask students to carry out a specific statistical procedure
on a given dataset.   By contrast, our approach leaves the
formation of the procedure for solving the problem up to 
the student himself, from beginning to end.  In so doing,
our approach motivates students to  take ownership of the
problem in the way a consultant takes ownership of a problem
when asked  to do so by a client.  To capture the
difference between the more typical case study approach 
and our approach, we follow the suggestion of one of our
reviewers and call our case studies  "active case
studies."</p>

<p>8 The active case studies we describe are not specific to
a single course or even a specific level.  We have used
them in our separate classes at both the graduate and
undergraduate levels.  A common feature of our classes,
however, is their  moderately small size of approximately
25 that allows for open class discussion.  We believe  that
the positive effects we have observed using this approach
will generalize to other  situations and problems.  There
is no doubt that an interesting data or design problem is 
an important ingredient to that generalization.  Another
important ingredient, however,  is the ability of the
instructor to express to the class a genuine interest in
obtaining  the solution to the problem in much the same way
a client expresses that interest to a  consultant.</p>

<p>9 In the following sections of this paper, we give
examples of five active case studies  which we believe have
helped to create an environment for our students where
learning is  memorable, knowledge is useful, and research
design and data analysis are valued.</p>

<h1>2.  General Principles Exemplified by Authentic Consulting Situations</h1>


<p><big><b>General Principle 1</b></big>:

<i>"Pilot studies are almost always worth the time and
effort.   Carry out a pilot study if any facet of your
design needs clarification."</i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#light">Light, Singer, and Willett 1990</a>, p.
213)</p>


<p>10 Students are presented with the following situation
that illustrates General Principle 1.    They are asked to
consider the situation at home and to come to the next
class with a well  thought out solution.  They are told
that at the next class they will be called upon to  present
their solutions and to defend them.</p>

<h3>Situation 1</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I and two other NYU faculty members are the recipients
of a large grant from NIDA,  the National Institute of Drug
Abuse, to study whether estimates of adolescent risk 
behavior calculated by such organizations as Monitoring The
Future (MTF) are biased.   MTF estimates of adolescent
risk behavior are based, with some modification, on a 
one-stage sampling design.  That is, MTF randomly selects a
given number of cooperating  high schools and distributes
questionnaires to students in required classes  in
10<sup>th</sup> grade.  If MTF captures at least 70% of the
students in a given school,  it includes those
questionnaires in its estimates of adolescent risk behavior
and does  not return on a later date to collect information
from those who were absent or otherwise  not present in the
classroom on that day.  If MTF captures less than 70%, it
returns on  another day to obtain additional responses. 
If, after the second attempt, the percentage  captured is
still less than 70%, MTF discards the data from that school
on the rationale that  fewer than 70% cannot represent well
all those enrolled in 10<sup>th</sup> grade for that 
school.</p>

<p>Our grant is to study whether MTF estimates are biased
by not including the information  on the remaining 30% or
more.  Said differently, we question whether the 30% or
more that  are not present to take the questionnaire are
systematically different in their risk behavior  from those
who are present.  We have proposed a four-stage sampling
design on twelve public  high schools randomly selected
from the total number of high schools in New York City. 
While the first  two stages replicate the MTF procedure,
the last two stages, stages 3 and 4, use an incentive  to
attract students to complete the questionnaire.  Clearly,
the use of an appropriate  incentive is critical to our
project to attract the chronically absent or cutting
students.   Without such incentive, the data for judging
whether estimates of adolescent risk behavior based on
modified single-stage sampling designs are biased will not
be available to us.</p>

<p>We decide to subcontract out to you the task of
determining the incentive that we should  use at stages 3
and 4.  Our budget allows us to spend no more than $15 per
student.   Because NIDA does not allow giving each student
$15 in cash (they are concerned that some  students will
use the money to buy illegal substances), what is your
proposal for determining  an appropriate incentive?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>11 At the next class meeting we began by asking for
volunteers to begin the discussion of  plausible
solutions.   Because all students had a chance to think
through the issues of the  problem at home, they came to
class prepared to discuss and evaluate the
potential  strengths and weaknesses of each proposal
suggested.  The in-class discussion was lively and 
animated.   Some students suggested gift certificates to
Burger King or McDonald's.  Others  suggested tickets to
baseball games and other sporting events.  No one came up
with the idea  of tailoring the gift to a particular school
or student body within a school, even though many  of the
objections raised by students concerned the proposed choice
of a particular gift (the  particular sporting event or
restaurant chain).  After all students who were interested
in  presenting their solutions had done so, we revealed
what actually occurred in carrying out  our research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order to determine what types of incentives would be
most effective, even before  the pilot study, we conducted
a focus group with 12 students from a high school in the
Lower  East Side of Manhattan.  The students all agreed
that $15 gift certificates to Tower  Records, a local
music store, would serve as sufficient incentive for other
students in the New York City area.</p>

<p>Our pilot study was conducted in two high schools, one
in midtown Manhattan and the  other in the Bronx.  When
incentives were distributed at these schools, we quickly
learned  that (1) Tower Records was not reachable via
public transport in the Bronx, and (2) the  students did
not consider $15 enough to purchase something suitable. 
Due to the combination  of these two factors, our response
rates during the later parts of the study were not 
remotely close to what was originally expected. 
Accordingly, we decided to tailor the  incentives to the
school being surveyed.</p>

<p>Prior to the full-scale study, student representatives
from each school were asked to  complete an information
sheet on directions to the school as well as what they
considered  to be an appropriate incentive. Responses
included movie tickets to local theaters and gift 
certificates to Old Navy, a retail clothing store.  Because
movie tickets involved dealing  with several different
movie chains, we decided to use the gift certificate to Old
Navy as  our incentive.  There is at least one Old Navy
store in every borough of New York City (and all are  near
some form of public transportation).</p>

<p>Despite the "tailoring" of incentives, the
issue of amount again became a  problem.  Students
complained, quite frequently, that $15 was not enough to
buy anything  substantial.  To determine whether
the incentives were indeed the reason why  response rates
at stages 3 and 4 were so low, the amounts were doubled at
three high  schools.  The results showed that doubling the
amount to $30 increased response rates  at stages 3 and 4,
and especially at stage 4 (see Tables 1 through 4).</p>

<blockquote>  
<p>We learned from the pilot study that two main
considerations in using incentives are amount  and type. 
For our purposes, using $30 gift certificates in 15 schools
(two in the pilot and  13 in the full-scale study) would
have been too costly.  However, tailoring the incentive  to
each school student body was possible and did have a
positive effect.</p> </blockquote>

<h3>Student Reaction 1</h3>

<p>12 Students were surprised to learn that we experienced a
number of false starts in coming up  with an appropriate
incentive and saw how essential the pilot study was in this
case.  They  expressed genuine appreciation for the now
obvious importance of field testing critical  aspects of a
study before it is undertaken and became interested in the
kind of pilot studies  that they might conduct in relation
to their own research studies, currently in the planning 
stages.  Clearly, they were able to transfer their
appreciation for the importance of a pilot  study from this
specific case to their own studies, suggesting that
anchored instruction is  not inconsistent with more
generalized learning.</p>
<br>

<p><big><b>General Principle 2</b></big>:

<i>"It should be remembered that numeric summaries are
just that; they summarize  characteristics of
distributions.  Thus, the analysis should begin with the
data,  not with summaries of the data."</i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#hartwig">Hartwig and Dearing 1979</a>, p. 16) </p>


<p>13 Students are asked to consider for homework the
following situation that  illustrates General Principle 2
and to come to class prepared to present a  plausible
solution that they can defend.</p>

<h3>Situation 2</h3>

<blockquote> 
<p>In response to pressure from the federal government, the
National Center for  Education Statistics (NCES) designed
the National Educational Longitudinal Study  (NELS) to
monitor the progress of student achievement in the U.S.  In
1988 the  NCES collected data on a sample of 25,000 cases
selected randomly from the population  of U.S.
8<sup>th</sup> graders. They also conducted two-year
follow-ups in 10<sup>th</sup>  grade, 12<sup>th</sup>
grade, and two years post-secondary.  One of the many
variables  recorded is grade point average through the
highest grade attended.   Based on the  total number of
cases from the Northeast and West who have values on this
variable  (2,027 from the Northeast and 3,014 from the
West), we find that the median grade  point average 
for students in the West is lower than that for students
in  the Northeast.  In particular, the Northeast has a
median grade point average of  3.51, while the West has a
median grade point average of 2.76.</p>

<p>We are baffled by this result and hire you as our
consultant to explain it to us.  You may access the
complete set of data at the computer lab.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>14 At the next class meeting we asked for volunteers to
explain our obtained results.   We began with those
students who did not refer to the actual dataset in coming
up with  their solutions.  Once again, the discussion
turned out to be quite lively.  Many students  presented
explanations that revolved around issues of grade
inflation, achievement  motivation, academic preparedness,
drop-out rates, ability, and even the sunny weather  in the
West!  After these were presented, we then asked the few
students who had examined  the data to present their
solutions.   As they had learned, the true and most
obvious  explanation is revealed by the data themselves.
</p>



<p>15 As startling as it may be, as shown in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#table5">Table 5</a>, at least two different grading
scales or  metrics were used by NCES to enter grade point
average.  One metric uses a scale from  0 to 4, where 4
represents a grade of A, 3 represents a grade of B, and so
on.  Another metric uses a percentage scale ranging from
0 to 100.  The discrepancy in medians is an artifact of how
these data were recorded  and entered.  Simply stated,
schools from the Northeast use the 0 to 100 grading scale 
with greater relative frequency than schools from the West,
which tend to use the 0 to 4  grading scale.</p>

<h3>Student Reaction 2</h3>

<p>16 The vast majority of students who did not review the
data themselves to look for  anomalies and irregularities
and who relied instead on the medians alone to develop
their  elaborate explanations of cause clearly felt duped. 
They were genuinely surprised by  the simplicity of the
explanation of the finding, and, more importantly, they
were surprised  that a reputable organization such as the
NCES would have measured a variable like grade  point
average on two very  different scales.  This example
illustrated quite clearly to students that data analysts
must not only be concerned about the usual types of data
anomalies and  irregularities, but also about even more
basic and  unusual types of anomalies as well.  The degree
of surprise expressed by students suggests how powerfully
the point had been made; they should remember this general
principle well and interpret summary statistics with
caution until a full description of the underlying data is
known.</p> <br>

<p><big><b>General Principle 3</b></big>:

<i> In constructing a summated rating scale, "response
choices are chosen so that  they can be ordered along a
measurement continuum.  Frequency varies from
nonoccurrence  (none or never) to constant occurrence
(always or continually)"</i>  (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#spector">Spector 1992</a>, <nobr>p. 21</nobr>). </p>

<p>17 We assigned the following homework problem that
asked students to consult on  a current project with which
the senior author was involved as a consultant.  The 
project concerned the evaluation of the effectiveness of a
speech and language treatment  program for individuals with
aphasia.</p>

<h3>Situation 3</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Aphasia is an acquired communication disorder that
impairs the ability to express  oneself using speech and/or to understand speech.  Aphasia may also affect one's
ability  to use writing or reading as a means of
communication.  Degree of impairment may range from  mild
to severe.  The impact of aphasia on the quality of life
for both the impaired person  and his or her family is
dramatic and devastating.  Individuals with aphasia find
themselves  alienated from their communities and forced to
negotiate a new relationship with the speaking  world.  Few
are able to participate fully as members of their
communities, and the majority  remain socially
isolated.</p>

<p>A program has been developed for people suffering from
aphasia at a Speech-Language  Pathology Department at a
local Medical Center.  This program provides 60 patients
and  their caregivers with speech-language pathology
services and social service follow-up for  a one-year
period.  It is hypothesized that such treatment will lead
to positive increases  in quality of life.  The first ten
items from the quality of life instrument along with  a
scale for their scoring, as given to us by the assistant to
the director of this program,  appear in Tables 6 and 7,
respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on a review of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#table6">Tables 6</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#table7">7</a>, what data analytic
issues would you address  with the medical personnel who
have hired you to help them to evaluate the effectiveness 
of their program on quality of life?   In particular, how
might the frequencies that  define the scoring scale be
changed to a different set of response choices that can be 
ordered along a measurement continuum?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Student Reaction 3</h3>

<p>18 Students were quick to identify potential problems
with the scoring scale.  In  particular, they noted the
fact that response choices as defined were not ordered 
along a measurement continuum.  They noted that while
response choices 1, 2, and 3  are on a continuum, and
response choices 4, 5, and 6 are as well, as a set, 4, 5, 
and 6 do not follow the continuum defined by 1, 2, and 3. 
In particular, if the  score of 3 is assigned to the
frequency 1-2 times per week, it does not follow that  a
score of 4 is assigned to the frequency 1-2 times in 3
months.  Students were  convinced, as they should have
been, that additional information on the validity  of this
scale needed to be obtained before any data analysis was
carried out.</p>

<p>19 At this point, students were given a copy of the paper
describing the quality of  life scale (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#holbrook">Holbrook and Skilbeck 1983</a>).  This
paper contained  information on the psychometric properties
of the instrument.  It also presented a scale for scoring
the items that was actually different from what the
program assistant had given  us.   In particular, the first
two items (preparing main meals and washing up) were 
scaled by the categories never, less than once per week,
1-2 times per week, and most  days.  These categories were
assigned the values 1 through 4, respectively.  The 
remaining eight items were scaled by the categories never,
1-2 times in 3 months,  3-12 times in 3 months, and at
least weekly.   These categories were also assigned  the
values 1 through 4, respectively.  Hence, both sets of
categories were ordinal,  as they should have been.</p>

<p>20 Guided class discussion focused on how a single set of
categories could be used  for all ten activities to
understand the rationale for the test developer's choice 
of using two different sets of categories. One student
suggested that perhaps both  sets of categories could be
viewed more generally in terms of the degree of similarity 
to normative behavior relative to each activity, under the
assumption that the  individuals taking this test perform
these activities at the normative rate or less.   In
particular, because washing up is normally conducted on
most days, the highest score  of 4 is assigned to
individuals who wash up on most days.  Likewise, because
local  shopping is normally conducted at least weekly, the
highest score of 4 is assigned to  individuals who do their
local shopping at least weekly.   This led to a discussion
of  the definition of normative behavior and to further
criticisms of these scales.</p>

<p>21 This authentic consulting situation showed students
the importance of examining the  underlying scales of
measurement that individuals plan to use for data
collection before  such data are analyzed.   It was an
example that demonstrated clearly that when conducting 
data analyses, all data-related issues must be explored,
including the validity of the  measurement scales on which
the data are based.   Through this example, students began 
to appreciate how knowledge may be used actively to uncover
truths about the phenomena  they are studying -- that is,
by beginning an analysis by scrutinizing the scores
themselves  and the scales that generated them.</p> <br>

<p><big><b>General Principle 4</b></big>:

<i>"A detailed description of the data, including
possible anomalies, and an ample  characterization of
results, are critical components of any data analytic
plan."</i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#weinberg">Weinberg and
Abramowitz</a>, in press, p. 1) </p>

<h3>Situation 4</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>During the Fall 1998 semester, Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa were involved in a tight  race to break Roger Maris'
1961 home run record of 61 home runs hit in a single
season.  Yet, during the final phase of the competition,
Mark McGwire received the lion's share  of media attention.
For those of us who were captivated by this competition and
who had  not followed baseball seriously in previous
seasons, the difference in media attention  was
perplexing.</p>

<p>While one could explain the attention given to Mark
McGwire as due, in part, to the  fact that McGwire led
Sosa  in home runs during the  season (although not by very
much at times), it is also possible that their past season
home run histories could have contributed to the difference
in attention they received.</p>

<p>Consider yourself hired as a consultant to come up with
answers to this question.   For your information, we have
attached the home run and at-bats histories of both
players  in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#table8"><nobr>Table 8</nobr></a>. 
During the 1993 and 1994 seasons, Mark McGwire was injured
early in the season  and was removed from the lineup, as
reflected by his low number of at-bats.  During the 1992 
season, Sosa was injured early in the season and also was
removed from the lineup, as  reflected by his low number of
at-bats.  Sosa joined the major leagues in 1989, while 
McGwire joined in 1986.</p> </blockquote>

<h3>Student Reaction 4</h3>

<p>22 Students enjoyed this problem because of the currency
of the issues it raised.  The  data related directly to
what were then current headlines in the daily newspapers,
and  they provided meaning for understanding those
headlines.  Discussion about the data was animated, and
even the students in the class who were less inclined, in
general, to be captivated by sports data, were captivated
in this case because of the history-making  nature of the
event.  This assignment allowed students to begin to
appreciate the value  of statistics as a set of relevant
and vital tools for answering interesting questions  that
relate to real situations making national headlines.</p>

<p>23 Students raised issues related to data entry (defining
the variables to enter,  including grouping variables, in
the dataset) and data screening (whether to include  the
rookie seasons and the injury-shortened seasons).  They
raised issues related to  the creation of new variables
(the ratio of at-bats to home runs, indicating the number 
of times a player is at bat for each home run he hits) that
are transformations of existing variables in the dataset. 
They were also able to observe that media coverage was
better predicted by using measures of consistency and
location together than by using either measure
alone.</p> 
<br>

<p><big><b>General Principle 5</b></big>:

<i> Predictors should be included in a design because they
are substantively interesting  or important. They should
also be incorporated "for two other reasons:  (1) to
disentangle the effects of the substantive predictors from
the effects of other,  less-important, 'background'
characteristics; (2) to determine whether two  (or more)
predictors interact in their relationship with the outcome
variable"</i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#light">Light, Singer, and
Willett 1990</a>, p. 86). </p>

<p>24 Unlike the first four principles, General Principle 5
was the focus of an entire  one-semester course on data
analysis, rather than of a single example.  This approach 
was similar to "the generation of cases and management
games" (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#welsch">Welsch 1992</a>, p. 303) 
used by business schools.</p>

<h3>Situation 5</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>You are given 534 observations on 11 variables including
hourly wage, occupational status,  years of experience,
years of education, sex, union membership, marital status,
and region of  residence, sampled from the Current
Population Survey of 1985 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#berndt">Berndt
1991</a>).  Access these data, submitted to StatLib by
Therese A. Stukel, Dartmouth College, from the academic
computing facility. Assume you are hired as a consultant to
determine whether there exists  a gender gap in wages. 
What data analytic issues are salient, and what data
analytic strategies  would you use?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Student Reaction 5</h3>

<p>25 Beginning with a simple independent groups
<i>t</i>-test, students spend the semester exploring 
issues relevant to the question of interest and analyzing
these data by taking into account  the issues raised.  As
noted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#welsch">Welsch (1992)</a>,  "as the
complexity of the problem is  revealed, increasingly
sophisticated statistical procedures can be introduced and
in the  end most of what is required in either a basic or
advanced course can be introduced"  (p. 303).  In this
particular case, issues regarding confounding,
transformations,  multicollinearity, categorical variables,
unbalanced ANOVA designs, interactions,  simple effects,
and model building strategies are discussed and illustrated
in the course  of the semester.   Students liked the fact
that a single relevant and interesting question  was
addressed and that a single set of real data was used
throughout.</p>

<p>26 Given that the data were real, and the issue they
raise was timely (a gender gap in wages),  students were
highly motivated to uncover the "true" answer to
the question posed.   Using one set of data throughout lent
cohesiveness to the structure of the course and gave 
students a fuller understanding of the issues one faces as
a data analyst.  Having students  role-play as consultants
added to their motivation to analyze these data to uncover
their  hidden meaning.   Students were evaluated through a
series of interim and final  reports written to the
employer (i.e., instructor) on latest findings.   Hence,
skills in the communication of statistical results were
enhanced as well.   In addition to the obvious statistical
knowledge learned through active exploration,  the course
served well to train students in what it is like to be a
statistical consultant  on an important and timely
issue.</p>

<h1>3. Conclusion</h1>

<p>27 These examples illustrate how general principles
typically read in texts or recited in  class can
come alive in the classroom through the use of real data or
situations  viewed by students as interesting and
important.  The senior author was personally  involved
in the first two situations as a consultant, and, as a
result, students attributed  a high level of importance to
these situations.  The remaining three situations
addressed  issues (an ongoing home run race, a comparison of
grade point averages, and a gender gap in wages)  that were
considered, by their timeliness, worthy of being solved. 
Because students were asked to serve as
"consultants" to these situations, they were
further  motivated to take ownership of these problems and
to find appropriate solutions.   By role-playing as
consultants, students appeared to be more willing to
volunteer their  solutions to the instructor and the
class.  By role-playing as the client, the instructor  was
able to create a collegial and friendly atmosphere in
the classroom where students  freely discussed the issues
and the approaches they used to address them.  Although no 
explicit measures were used to evaluate the effectiveness
of this approach, other less  formal approaches based on
instructor observations of student and classroom behavior
proved  helpful.  The level of student participation in
classroom discussions, the nature of student  questions
asked, and the connections made by students between the
situations presented in  class and their own emerging
research studies all contributed to a strong positive
impression  that the approach was effective in its ability
to anchor student learning, and to anchor it  well.</p>

<p>28 We believe that as long as we, as instructors, are
sensitive to the many opportunities  we have to convert
real world problems into active case studies for classroom
use, the  effort and preparation required to provide this
type of experience should be reasonably low.  We invite all
interested readers to make use of the situations and data 
presented in this paper.</p>

<p>29 In sum, this approach seeks to develop a deep
understanding of the principles of our  field by combining
directed instruction with opportunities for active and
critical  exploration of problems that exemplify such
principles.    Our ultimate  goal is to
support our students in their creation of a knowledge base
that is relevant  rather than extraneous, that is useful
rather than inert.   We must challenge ourselves  as
instructors of research methodology and data analysis to
collect timely and real  situations of substantive and
methodological interest and to use these situations in 
class.  In so doing, our students will learn from them and
from us what it is to use  the tools of their education
actively, rather than to merely acquire them.   Through 
this approach, our aim is to encourage our students to
"build an increasingly  rich implicit understanding of
the world in which they use the tools and of the tools
themselves" (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063918/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/secure/v8n2/weinberg.cfm#bradstreet">Bradstreet
